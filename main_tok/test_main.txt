4047 he would next one less o lineman since he could just do the blocking himself

9478 right wing conspiracy
9479 but this is what everybody does !
9480 because sarah sliverman always tells the truth .
9481 scotch actually tastes better using a spherical ice because the ice ball shape allows the ice to minimize surface area and thereby reduce total system energy even before cooling begins .

9514 they would n't be dead if they had guns .
9515 i 'll be honest , i thought lord business was supposed to trump , and could n't figure out who the guy behind the wall was .
9516 no ... my favorite app !

9569 this is my new favorite thing .
9570 to make it unhackable
9571 this is islamophobia .
9572 because there is only one trump supporter and people do n't work different hours .
9573 that 's an acid smile for sure
9574 maybe the other 57 % ; surely executive pay will go up , because only the best managers can cause labor costs to go down .

10301 i use this when i 'm not exactly thinking straight .
10302 when your unelected leadership suddenly jumps at the prospect of austerity , crippling bondage debt , selling off everything to the highest bidder , instead of cheap gas and interest free loans you begin to wonder who orchestrated this little coup , oh wait , no you do n't , you do n't wonder at all , because it is so blatantly obvious .

10384 nobody needs a car that goes that fast

12162 looks more like 10 am
12163 making big bruva proud
12164 fox news should be called the back stabbing rat fucking network .
12165 yes it is , but ut 's a great way for the wealthy to cull the less desirables .
12166 the lizard people just want you to think it might be because of his comments about jews , but it 's really because he did n't understand the metric system .
12167 you can never be sure that pirated copies of windows are botnet free , so best to disable them from the net .
12168 raw video .

12179 valve
12180 so nice of them to constitute what is `` normal '' and what is n't on your behalf
12181 then they should put world of warcraft lore questions on the driving test to rectify this .
12182 you look like a douchebag with that cardigan and bag .
12183 looks like a giant deep sea ocean floor creature swept ashore o.o the building itself is neat , but i 've got a pet peave about buildings that deviate too far from the `` theme '' , unless the city as whole has that all-or-nothing flair
12184 pupils are dilated and fixed , during broad daylight no less , this woman has a head injury get her to the er stat !

12198 proof of an intelligent designer !
12199 i think we should be implementing this same program now on a national level .
12200 it 's a good thing the op does n't have a union at the workplace , because the union would probably screw the company over by defending a lazy employee like the op who was fired for clearly valid reasons .
12201 hmm ... for some reason i was under the impression that there were multiple ways to play guitar
12202 is your history teacher 's blog reddit ?
12203 the bottom third of the comments looks a lot like gunnit : )
12204 considering how these weapons are considered less-than-lethal , should n't this crap technically constitute battery/attempted murder charges ?
12205 that is brilliant .
12206 who needs jobs when you have the govt ?
12207 i thought the crimea river was in the ukraine

12220 `` another '' `` scenery '' ftfy .
12221 we all know that 2nd amendment rights trump all other rights including property and 1st amendment rights .
12222 why did n't they shoot him ?
12223 i think i popped a blood vessel .
12224 the best
12225 i suppose authoritarian socialists ( the ones who seem to be downvoting this ) do n't have anything against oppressive bodies like the police and military .
12226 that 's because `` under god '' was added after that
12227 what is he doing about it then ?
12228 is n't this al gore 's new network ?
12229 it amazes me how they all just fall in line and believe everything that everyone types ...
12230 haha , america is so awesome it 's great to live in a country where being verbally disrespectful means jail time , fuck that 1st amendment who needs that anyway .

12237 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha fox will never stoop to that wacko idea .
12238 and it 's great , too , because it 's a social issue , as opposed to a `` real '' issue , so obviously all of a woman 's actual experiences or learned , academic knowledge can be negated by arguments and beliefs against feminism , beliefs which are not , in the slightest way at all , based upon internalised stereotypes and ignorance .
12239 it 's the fags fault !
12240 yeah , cause auto manufacturers never get sued !
12241 more palin derangement syndrome .
12242 but it 's the horrible education system 's fault that they are excited to not get what they are paying for

12263 the simple fact that you used the word `` score '' in your title suggests that you 're a fucking male pig chauvinist that has no interest in showing proper appreciation to the superior sex .

12265 stuart holden was never actually injured and has just been working on a return to esports for counter-strike : global offensive , but once the game turned out to be somewhat of a flop , he began his return to bolton .

12287 once they hit 18 there career is pretty much over .
12288 it bothers me how fenix was never mentioned in wol when he 's such a dominant character in sc1 and bw .
12289 so the real takeaway from this story is that the restaurant owner is obviously a greedy capitalist who can afford to pay his people more .
12290 oh boy , this should be interesting

12397 i hope the pro-russian opposition activists are n't mistreated and that un and nato are monitoring for human rights abuses .
12398 the important lesson is that the proper course of actions is always to create unpopular , unenforceable rules when confronted with challenges .
12399 but , but , but they * have * * to * ~~break~~ ~~the~~ ~~law~~ `` bend the rules '' to ~~arrest~~ ~~citizens~~ `` get the bad guys '' -- that 's what tv cop shows have taught me for years and years !

12407 why ca n't more guys be like him ?
12408 not true.it depends on who brings good development and governance.at local level , individual matters more than his party and sometimes state level , the party of the individual makes little difference compared to the work an individual has done to develop that region.once in a while though , gem like narsimha rao comes at national level to lead the charge in a party like congress .
12409 that `` party '' sure sounds like the end result of a craiglist ad .
12410 yep , thats one way to sure `` de-escalate '' the situation
12411 i heard that some tanks looked to glossy after the new patch but this is ridiculous !
12412 i 'm sure it will be a blockbuster .

17848 our very democrat , pro-union , uneducated , working-class , gun-loving , poor , fat , drug-riddled state will be a landslide for trump .
17849 imo this is worse : (
17850 because that crippling self-doubt during adolescence just melts away once you become an adult
17851 well he actually caught the ball so he must be better than obj

17874 i wish there was some way to prove these statements .
17875 not that i do n't believe it , but i 'm amazed he was able to hear anything from the stands with how loud it was in the dome .

17893 how do we know that this actually happened ?

17901 so when is obama declaring martial law and suspending the election to secure his 3rd term ?
17902 chopped and edited
17903 the suit will allege that he did n't give them permission to use his comments or video at his rallies and interviews .
17904 `` basically '' which means he does n't say that at all .

17939 just say `` chia head . ''
17940 a vacuum extension wand is great for ceiling vermin .
17941 i wonder what the police will rule about the mom who reported her son was bullied by the kid who tagged her son out in the baseball game .
17942 alot of people should n't be parents

17957 guys stop ... it wasnt funny the first 80 times the joke was made ....
17958 let me guess ... all faulty ballots in favor of trump ?
17959 because a government that doubled the national debt in 8 years has the authority to tell me how finances work
17960 clearly having the blood move to the edges would give you an unfair competitive advantage .
17961 is this just a screenshot from the force awakens ?
17962 it 's like when you show your friend something funny but then it 's just turn out to be 5 mins of cringe and focusing all your might to breath and to keep your face from doing that twitch you do when you 're uncomfortable .. especially when you smile
17963 lmao

17983 messina

17985 seriously makes me wonder what would be left after that .
17986 breeze will be the one to beat lesnar
17987 but did it wash your clothes ?

17990 its official - who fucking cares ?
17991 you tell me
17992 no because they 're black
17993 makes sense why he ca n't beat it
17994 it 's always been a achanging script .
17995 bill clinton did it first !
17996 shes trained in knife usage , because as a woman , she should be in the kitchen ^
17997 ~~the light one~~

18006 i want them to show the famous republican tribal loyalty and be immolated along with their chief .
18007 bob case sensitive .
18008 by saying giants birds , i really hope you are n't referring to woman who , i 'm sure your uneducated mind is unable to understand , have been called birds as a derogatory term for the last century .
18009 that looks nothing like a clown costume .
18010 watching this cross-eyed makes for a very trippy pseudo3d experience .
18011 who is *
18012 all i 'm going to say is that roger goodell never twerked , so your argument is invalid .
18013 please mark this [ nsfw ]
18014 its up for me now
18015 we need to win back the senate , or hillary 's first term is going to be really tough .
18016 no no no , this is trump playing 2147d reversi
18017 i think both should be on the header .
18018 ... what about the da vinci code ?
18019 arnold said `` you 're fired '' long before trump ever did
18020 bmw copied it from toyota !
18021 it 's not my job to educate you !
18022 photoshop

18025 you freaking white supremacist !
18026 keeping it classy , alabama
18027 you can clearly already see the enormous psychological advantage verstappen has gained over ricciardo this race , the usually very cool ricciardo already starts throwing with stuff
18028 yeah maybe his ptsd would n't be so bad if he was n't in uniform
18029 that 's gon ' work so well for them .

18042 that media hivemind everyone
18043 and if anyone knows a sociopath when he sees one it is a wall street ceo .

18059 shows he 's smart .
18060 [ i can not recall what this comment was before it was removed by a moderator ]
18061 yes , canadians flee en masse to accrue massive amounts of debt .
18062 seriously , when there were musings about the possibility of a private option , the outrage was so huge that the conservatives even came out said they would never do that .

18089 i know this is n't my best edit , but i found it difficult to blend the rotting corpse theme with a pristine condition animatronic - personally i think the cool spring bonnie hand puppet makes up for it ; ) also the feet look fucking awful , but trust me it looks way better than having f.freddy 's original feet there , they looked way too bland .
18090 dark souls
18091 he should have used a tab
18092 because he actually committed a crime , and trump did n't .

18153 how trump said the wrong date accidently .
18154 guessing they were low on budget
18155 alaska really has a problem , a president trump might sell alaska back to the russians to cover his personal debts .

18172 typically 24 fps is the highest framerate the eye can differentiate ... as individual pictures

20130 and some people here want to see a 10 man cruiserweight open .
20131 yupp
20132 not enough times
20133 wow it is totally unreasonable to assume that the agency that covered up bush war crimes because `` muh republican party '' would be partisan as fuck
20134 check in there as well !
20135 literally ones of people !
20136 rip sinner have fun burning in hell
20137 because the rest of the world knows we need to be done playing around with climate change ... plus , i guess they 're the only ones who could know for sure it 's not a hoax they made up .

20160 this wo n't lead to any problems down the line at all
20161 you can put in donald trump though lol
20162 better build a wall around salt lake city before the good mormons get loose .
20163 we 're not even 24 hours into november and the team is alredy in full november mode
20164 well hindsight is 20/20 i guess

20185 if trump is ahead of clinton , maybe johnson will win !
20186 does that nickname mean what i think it means ?
20187 horse-race politics is the new reality tv format by which we elect our leaders .
20188 pfft , this is obviously a false flag operation organized by george soros
20189 44 dollars for something that can be made in like 10 minutes
20190 soldier or sniper , sniper is very out of the way and can get kills on anyone really , soldier is very high damage output
20191 looks like clinton and her staff are at it again
20192 they 've done plenty , like shipping all the manufacturing jobs that allowed disadvantage people of all races to have a chance at the middle overseas
20193 well , if they were white and would vote gop , this would n't be a problem .
20194 what money ?
20195 ugh i spent $ 3 on it : (
20196 when it comes to battery improvements i see it coming from someone like madcatz first .

20238 the bitfinex scam is live and well - schedule maintenance to stop customers selling - sell on their account and only let them sell once the price has collapsed - profit !

20268 blue means social , you want to be social when your being anti-social dont ya ?
20269 its
20270 it 's getting hard to find the daily `` trump bitching about unfair media '' stories because you have to scroll through like 50 `` hillary emails '' stories .
20271 punk ass kids
20272 i wonder if he and melania have an `` understanding '' ... surely she has to know her husband cheats .

20280 makes complete sense .
20281 philipa is the strongest card in the game , if you plan on playing nr a bit get her
20282 are your siblings just as bad at answering questions as you are ?
20283 so basically the same thing with hillary clinton is she somehow magically wins except if we tried to protest we would be attacked by the supreme leader clinton rod-hil 's national guard while blm got to have their weekly riot and suburb burnings .
20284 that was quite a contribution to american society , too .
20285 remember , remember the 5th of november
20286 damn those oysters look good .
20287 i guess this is why we did n't want women voting .
20288 wait , i 'm pretty sure i read somewhere that `` gallowboob is against the rules ''

20292 sick strafes
20293 this should of just been a dink , and not a headshot .. but because the houses have such shit helmet spawns .... cough your loot spawns are fucking garbage dbg cough
20294 yeah , because his native american family will do so much better with trump as president .
20295 crazybus
20296 what is the actual story behind this ?
20297 i 'd put it down mainly for the whole activity being about enjoying being naked , and not equating nudity with sexuality right off the bat .
20298 guess that means i never should have approached that woman checking her bg ( blood sugar ) in public awhile back .
20299 is donald safe ?
20300 lmfao
20301 romo 's kryptonite ... december

20306 if i added up all the hours i spent on iv i could have become proficient in another language .
20307 i think they have 0 % chance to win now , since dust is not on this team .
20308 i wonder who they 're voting for .
20309 what are you doing smallcat ?
20310 thats weird , it is always my top and midlane 0/10/0 by 20 minutes .
20311 nearly 400 ranked games went from b2 to s4 feelsfuckinggreatman sry for bad english not my native language
20312 unexpected
20313 must be an old screenshot , i see only level 1 gyms .
20314 these conspiracy theories are really getting out of hand , not everything needs to part of some grand scheme to undermine trump .
20315 surprise he has a td
20316 maledette unioni civili
20317 potato quality
20318 gal gadot is pregnant , so ww is a mess confirmed !
20319 yeah quit letting the truth out !
20320 where is he i do n't see him
20321 like i said in the post that you obviously did n't read all of , they could easily title it `` zombies in spaceland easter egg attempt ''
20322 the whole investigation was a distraction from wikileaks .
20323 freedom needs no explanation
20324 these pictures would need some diversity according to dice .
20325 surely we 'll still have daily threads about gym stagnation but at least it seems they 're trying
20326 cool
20327 especially when it 's about feeling sick
20328 shocker .
20329 kbar is a ballistic weapon tho
20330 guess we can confirm no super ee

20339 why is it worded as though the election has already been decided ?
20340 i got the joke ... it 's just really fucked up haha
20341 i guess the period key was broken .
20342 they could use solar roadways to power this thing !
20343 not even a teamkill you call that a potg ?
20344 they also had a horrific pose which was thankfully removed .
20345 trump : the whole world is a safe space , or else .
20346 revolutionary design
20347 she was a piece of shit .
20348 and that is even without localbitcoins available in germany .
20349 since 7.1 a lot of us started having this problem .. yeah obviously the problem is at our side ..
20350 i 'm sure hillary will pardon him now instead of trying to kill him
20351 hm , so i 'm guessing that clinton +4 in this poll adjusts trump 's chances on 538 by +5 percent after you adjust for volatility and the enthusiasm gap ?
20352 i 'm not really trying to defend case but he did throw 266 yards against the cards this year .
20353 he was training another dog to film .
20354 you would n't have to do that often if you had a billion or two like ole ' donald .
20355 to piggy back , those of you who have not early voted before , why did you this time ?
20356 dota 2
20357 the classic rush truck centers scheme of 2016
20358 why this canyon look like a mario kart level

20360 that 's honestly amazing how could anyone want to ban something that can save people i just do n't understand why people are so stubborn .
20361 did n't go for the penta , reported for trolling kappa
20362 therefore trump is automatically president !
20363 gop : grab our privates .
20364 anyone else having a hard time entering ptr ?
20365 glad i waited all week for this .
20366 i 'm so excited for trump to claim that the election was indeed rigged because `` they found dozens of examples of fraudulent voting , '' only to be reminded that they all supported him .
20367 looks awesome
20368 we already had those 3 days of everyone being sombra pls no
20369 hooo ... jim knox crazy
20370 does it come with its own internet ?
20371 better luck next time .
20372 to be fair , you know it 's dangerous but a part of you wants to see stevie behind the wheel
20373 pink guy .
20374 you 're looking forward to the start of the salty conspiracy theories about how the person who should 've won did n't ?
20375 if money is n't an issue , go to one event on the 30th and fly out to the other on the 31st : - )

20389 all i know if the white sox somehow win again in the near future , the hawks better give them the same treatment !
20390 i 'm board
20391 we need to deport all illegal orcs and make azeroth great again .
20392 becky carried alexa since the day one !
20393 donald needs to put a bounty on this man and his family 's heads .
20394 she was voting her conscience

20405 so ... what you 're telling me is that white people are impatient ?
20406 she has to sound the names out
20407 well the gun ban in chicago worked , so i do n't see why this would n't .
20408 if there are n't enough jobs for lawyers , the law school should find it relatively easy to hire new staff to teach law ?
20409 because right now there is no government corruption/tyranny
20410 come back and tell us when it actually happens , until then this is not news .
20411 looks like i 'll be needing to go back to the persona 4 endurance run to help me through a bit !
20412 i always thought that when it 's all said and done the only thing that really mattered in terms of undecided voters were the debates .
20413 man we missed a trick there
20414 well , i guess this is it , trump is our new president
20415 after today they 'll never have to again !
20416 this does n't scream `` trashy '' to me .
20417 those old vhs quality music videos upscale so well
20418 `` muh future ''
20419 very tolerant imo
20420 oh , i 'm sure there be no trouble from a trump white house .
20421 hitler was n't funny while he was being terrible , so nah .
20422 is this the answer for trump 's victory ?
20423 we can see how it would have been if hillary was elected
20424 eh ... that 's not really much at all for a federal budget of a global power ?
20425 it 's so jarring .
20426 wow ... how cool ... this is all so funny .
20427 great booby prize .
20428 yeah , we could all really come together if a party won the presidency with 12 % of the vote !

20450 that was not acceptable despite your implication .
20451 when hillary actually got more votes than trump
20452 good thing the sanitation truck is there to discard all that shit
20453 this is why i carry .
20454 where 's the liberal defense of this action ?
20455 yeah but hillary can dab

20457 claim survivor n1
20458 i can make one out of an avocado , an ice-pick , and a snorkel .
20459 nice map of the world

20465 that 's not propaganda at all !
20466 i just played it for the first time last year and really enjoyed myself .
20467 i wonder if they will ever know how patronizing they sound .
20468 in other words , shaun king is an expert on law enforcement and would make the perfect police officer .
20469 you did something wrong to piss him off .
20470 i think this has been already established when he campaigned for racist hillary .
20471 let 's face it , most high school kids are assholes .
20472 thats stupid , you 're stupid .
20473 oh dear , this is some good shit , i will have my company look into getting this into production
20474 i do n't know if there is anyone more privelaged than a suburban white girl in america .
20475 common dreams once again proves they are more fake liberal than the democratic party they attack .
20476 .... and not one of these kids will be housed anywhere near the homes of tds ....... sure lets send them to rural ireland where the towns are already overrun with immigrants and their ever extending welfare dependant families ....... bunch of pc cunts
20477 shocking .
20478 if the m4a4 didnt sound like utter shit id 100 % use it
20479 oh boy , because negging works * so * well .
20480 hacks .
20481 * * chieftain randomly breaks down * *
20482 it 's crazy how many violent racists have all of a sudden sprung into action ... all wearing trump gear no doubt .
20483 thanks trump .
20484 yeah but she was just so gosh darn electable .
20485 connor looks like he is dressed to compete in the pimp of the year contest .
20486 i fuckin hate homeless people .

20499 s.s smoke
20500 this is a shitpost even by * your * standards !
20501 and i 'm like who is kablaze ?
20502 i love it when a mam with no political experience is assigned to the most political jib in the world .
20503 on my junior high football team , color represented blocking scheme and number represented gap .
20504 ya that is totally herpies
20505 i 'd wager that if put up for a referendum in california , oregon , and washington , each state would vote to stay into the union .
20506 the only hatemongering and fear and racism in this country right now is coming from the people who supported hillary clinton .
20507 yes , we can feel safe knowing that trump 's foreign policy wo n't be destructive .
20508 it 's important to use veteran 's day as another opportunity to take a jab at atheists , and remind our atheist veterans that they do n't exist and do n't count .
20509 omg there 's like 3 people all driving on the wrong side of the road those maniacs
20510 notch should buy up all the 356cl 's

20518 - reporter jacob wolf nothing to see here
20519 he 's fired .
20520 if she has him adopted her next child could be a democrat .
20521 because if you want to give a negative opinion you are * obligated * to give constructive criticism
20522 how does one become friends with the legend himself , brofresco ?
20523 well , at least he 's draining his own swamp
20524 til that a man from arizona sold $ 20 of weed for a diamond worth $ 160k !
20525 so bad u cant carry bro lmao
20526 wow your literally a genius
20527 that makes sense , seeing as though there 's literally nothing else to fucking do there except go to the beach and get fucked
20528 everyone knows that maserati is the poor man 's ferrari
20529 does she have any actual experience in the pentagon ?
20530 feels like the whole world is taking crazy pills lately .
20531 does this mean no ngc chip ?
20532 so much tolerance
20533 sold out since june , iirc
20534 nooooo , really ?
20535 3 mana spirit claws ?
20536 oh , sure , * now * he starts lying .
20537 hopefully you have a gtx 1070 and plan to play that on ultra low .
20538 nice try thief !
20539 but dom said he felt pretty weak
20540 wikileaks does n't have their own agenda though , its not possible because they leak information .
20541 flintstones always had to go to water hole but good guy judge judy is making the door come to their water
20542 hey scott , hows it going !
20543 sa aquino yan , dilaw e
20544 breaking news on cnn : trump finds penny on white house floor , lies about taking money from the government
20545 xg270hu master race
20546 star gazing
20547 i read that as `` almost won 15 thousand '' and was all confused .. `` what the shit does he need to do to win 15 k , that shot was perfect ''
20548 na challenger gameplay
20549 no because they have privilege
20550 so the jews did do it !
20551 i think they were propositioning him for the ultimate alt-right past time of watching your wife get fucked while ranting about commies and helicopters .
20552 does not surprise me one bit .
20553 suspect is described as an african america late teen in hoodie .
20554 but he ran as the republican nominee , he 's definitely better for israel than the democratic one !
20555 what 's a loading screen ?

20564 kasalanan ni pnoy yan !
20565 is there any way to send this to tinder and get him banned from using the app ?
20566 eeweeie
20567 no difference from the usual then , since everyone looks bronze next to faker
20568 she *
20569 but it 's so much easier to say `` i told you so '' no matter who wins
20570 plot twist : op is the one who started this whatsapp forward .
20571 yeah , back when they were making up names for various sciences `` trick '' just did n't sound official enough , so they came up with `` psychology ''
20572 nobody cares , as long as he was anti-trump he was a good guy .
20573 you might be onto something there , ca n't believe no one has though of that yet
20574 equally that trust in the scientific community and scientific procedures is the same as having `` faith '' i 'm just a student so not a 'scientist ' yet but to have somebody tell me that i `` basically have faith in the same way '' pisses me off .
20575 ca n't wait to hear fans calling for hackenberg all week on sports radio !
20576 glad to see you are putting our money to good use .
20577 i like that it just floats on your wall .
20578 i like girls hair more
20579 obviously baby boomers have a long history of never rioting
20580 clearly he 's just upset at the loss of manufacturing jobs in the rust belt .
20581 i beg to differ .
20582 i swear to god these people find new ways of being uniquely creepy
20583 kinda distasteful imo
20584 friday nights can be a bit crazy on the farm .
20585 when weber hurts his team .
20586 nah mate you 're just a bigot , i learned all about it in women 's studies at uni
20587 no they fucking do n't
20588 director of internal newsletters , tops .
20589 hundreds ... impressive
20590 jesus
20591 man that republican looks pretty triggered , we should let them get to a gun store or let them go hunting , thats their safe space right ?
20592 yes , forego the efforts of 200+ years of independence to rejoin the queens colonies .
20593 laughable comparison for the most part
20594 hmm ... ten
20595 how they 're actually treating the heroin crisis up there giving people access to the drugs in a safe place with professional nurses and etc , do it like america and just lock them up in jail assholes .
20596 ffs nerf vinktar already
20597 good thing climate change science is a hoax , guys !
20598 why do they insist on cutting their haor short .
20599 naw , placing an entire country at the complete mercy of its banking system with no recourse whatsoever is a good idea .
20600 specifically , he 's mike love 's son .
20601 legacy .
20602 yes , with two players from a team that was in the relegation tournament
20603 we all know that it was yellowstar 's brilliant leadership that carried fnatic s5 huni more like whoni
20604 the heat vision so i can lock on to my enemy across the map
20605 ahhh the boar control memes
20606 i never liked him from the times we had meetings he seemed to really not care about supporters at all , unless it was to sell the more expensive seats by using our imaging then he was all over it .
20607 for who 's benefit is this comedy pay-for-protest schtick ?
20608 is the balance pass sucks ?
20609 man , how is wikileaks not * all over * this ?
20610 great source !
20611 is it still there ?
20612 time to nerf ?
20613 konami ... have n't heard that name in a while
20614 you ai n't fooling nobody we all know that he 's a russian kkk member in a blackface
20615 get out * * stupid sjw * *
20616 genuinely shocked by this .
20617 a team like splyce should pick him up seems really good
20618 * unsubbs *
20619 sars
20620 i think they 're special because you cant photoshop a polaroid lmao
20621 errorname , the less known brother of missingno .
20622 yeah , making torture illegal is so dumb !
20623 i just ca n't get over the huge fake vents .
20624 damn , where do you buy radiators that do n't require an active airflow ?
20625 actually , there are more truck driver jobs than truckers to work them , so this autonomous wave will actually be a huge boon for everybody .
20626 i 'm sure it was a russian white supremacist , donald trump supporter !
20627 if that was a joke , then it 's so bad it 's actually funny .
20628 because listening to quiet death metal is pretty much pointless .
20629 so salty .
20630 not another email scandal .
20631 zen main btw
20632 obviously you are n't aware that that flag is about heritage , not hate .
20633 i refuse to purchase this until the name is changed to its proper title `` total warhammer '' .
20634 inb4 hundreds of innocent people get their accounts locked for having cheat engine on their pcs .
20635 definitely skewed due to the great depression/recession crashes under republican presidents and then the bounce-backs under democratic presidents
20636 hillary supporters are out of control .
20637 because the guilt would definitely be enough .
20638 top notch flair
20639 why always ugly ass viewmodel
20640 is n't it normally the other way around ?
20641 well reptilians already do .
20642 and for bonus points jenner does n't even work as a symbol of liberalism , because she 's a conservative and the lgbt community finds her views repulsive .
20643 they 're already working on winning him the second term , apparently
20644 feitenvrije identiteitspartijen .. de vloek voor de parlementaire democratie .
20645 the dinosaurs were super sinful , or satan just made the fake bones , not sure which .
20646 well nothing 's going to change their vote more than being harassed
20647 `` thanks mkbhd ''
20648 i thought they meant the third party package manager for os x
20649 wow instead of fixing the loading screen bug they just band-aid it with a new one
20650 a tasty morsel i shall save for later
20651 date 11-18-14 i 'm sure this is legit and your picture
20652 cool opinion bro

20658 hey if you look at the last two games we played , it 's almost like we won one of them !
20659 but what happened ?
20660 i do n't even care how obvious it is he 's banging his food critic , i love old people .
20661 trade in unused qs meal credits for three snacks such as mickey krispy treats on your last day !
20662 seems legit
20663 who even upvotes shit like this ?
20664 it was n't his turn .
20665 such primitive technology
20666 pretty funny that no one gets the joke .
20667 because we spent so much time at the debates and on the campaign trail discussing climate .
20668 worst is the tenured academics who continue to act like there 's an election to be won , oppressing the views of normal people in education with their batshit ideas about gender .
20669 how does a baby know how to use reddit ?
20670 i am the father of three kids and a man
20671 ye

20673 it 's like they always say , the big 12 is a basketball conference
20674 echo fox buys heroic one can dream

20679 a good thing he 's about transparency !
20680 another white , privileged male is probably going to get off easy with rape .
20681 i guess quitting drugs is pretty easy when you get to bang ariana
20682 you do realise that with 62 million votes , around 20 % of the us voted for hilary .
20683 yeah , fuck the receptionist and hr personnel .
20684 spoiler alert - that nation state was the usa .
20685 haha
20686 roshes ruined it
20687 so dks are why buff classes died : (
20688 paywall
20689 clearly that is because pitcher wins are clearly the most important stat .
20690 duterte and his supporters : triggered
20691 overnight , my dick grew an inch and a half the night trump was elected .
20692 why
20693 the pz iv f2 and g are far better tanks in my experience .
20694 we all know the true bird of canada
20695 eyebrows maybe could be changed and try to make the nose a little thinner .
20696 you already posted this today you clickbaiting fuck .
20697 what a game manager !
20698 that boob job makes her music way more tolerable .
20699 best game i 've ever played , even if uncharted 2 was slightly more 'fun ' .
20700 dark and delightsome .
20701 they can go to another state .
20702 somewhere khris middleton is sad
20703 just alerting that stick of truth is getting a remastered version for xb1 .
20704 they did lose though
20705 karma for getting both midnight and hidden shoulders .
20706 photo hai kya ladki ki ?
20707 this is ether a win for diversity or i 'm going to hell for finding this way too funny !
20708 and let 's not forget that other great precedent from one of donald trump 's heroes who had jews wear stars of david on their clothing .
20709 mazda says some things that mean nothing .
20710 so glad we freed ourselves from the oppressive eu
20711 wow , that 's probably like 3 whole man years worth
20712 you have to admit it 's slowed down the traffic on our road
20713 yeah i deserve to have my rights taken away because i belong to a certain group , thanks for being honest
20714 no but i 'll help fund it !
20715 oh you should just get an unpaid internship !
20716 how the `` great and abominable church '' actually * is * the catholic church and all those weirdos in gospel doctrine were right all along .
20717 well that solves it megyn kelly is clearly a liberal shill !
20718 boooo you did n't even kill the kraken
20719 who ?
20720 i guess the moderators are really enjoying with this one
20721 i learned loafers are making a comeback !
20722 you can do my morphology homework for me
20723 apparently it pays pretty well to be a protester .
20724 man trainees are really young these days .
20725 how dare they take all the antifreeze , that was reserved for my vape 's e-juice !
20726 this guy is going to be a blast to sit with at the thanksgiving table .
20727 why do all the smart guys predict the end of human life and not the winning lotto numbers
20728 onions cry when they see him
20729 i like how he smiles after getting hit , whereas after bieber was hit he cried like a bitch .
20730 who says weed does n't make you paranoid ?
20731 would you take carey price for a large bag of pure gold pucks and the most expensive diamond in the world ?
20732 darn furries .
20733 it sounds like something out of the binding of isaac
20734 `` both are described as medium height , medium build , with dark hair '' damn , pretty sure i know those guys !
20735 yay !
20736 hahahahahahahaa
20737 the only thing vicious about mine is what she leaves in her water bowl every couple months !
20738 awwwyisss
20739 a lot of us never did in the first place
20740 ahh yes ... the rare southern nope post in all its glory .
20741 accurate english scenery .
20742 i wonder how he 'll respond to all the hate and backlash he 'll get for saying that
20743 i am an ordained minister of the pastafarian religion , and my soul has been touched by our glorious lord and savior , flying spaghetti monster .
20744 damn i have no idea how he will stand fn good luck to him though

20746 nightfall 100 % drop rate
20747 and marijuana ... : (
20748 i wanted to ask some trumpists about donalds administration appointments , but now there 's no `` safe space '' to hear a defense !
20749 but will the prediction line be able to calculate the goalposts ?
20750 at least fire 's on-scene to help .
20751 omg watch your microaggressions !
20752 i can see why the religious right really like him .
20753 so black people do age , if they have a job .
20754 for his age he looked young before and still looks young after
20755 that expensive headset the gods of non-prime mg1 always wear
20756 it 's all in your head dude
20757 warren should have endorsed bernie sanders
20758 rilasciato dopo una chiamata della minetti in questura , pare sia passato come uno dei figli illegittimi di trump
20759 does n't matter ... he said that thing once , and now he 's a racist , homophobe .
20760 just curious will this have any impact on the charges against the other 3 ?
20761 maybe a whole season surrounding it , maybe with drugs too , that ca n't turn out bad .
20762 maybe it was an octomom situation
20763 ca n't hear sh * t !
20764 ummmmmm they use the same weapon .
20765 and this is what we call skill
20766 rmb all day .
20767 do you understand what gay means ?
20768 he was a product of his qb , obviously ...
20769 its definitely the system idle process
20770 not even december , goes full on christmas style and music lol
20771 did you just assume a gender , shitlord ?
20772 have you considered that you may be fa because you 're a table ?
20773 this guy could 've been president lol you snooze you lose we america now beetches
20774 according to your statement 's logic , then they should have been a subreddit for tournaments , shitposting , awesome plays , etc .
20775 call it the magic stick : : : )
20776 changi 's marketing team very clever
20777 looked like the process
20778 brave man
20779 but , but , it 's different ... because ... reasons .
20780 very classy hamilton .
20781 i still do n't know if he really meant ostrich or ostracized .
20782 clearly they speak british .... god get it right .
20783 them and blackberry i bet .
20784 i did n't realize it , i just woke up one morning and decided i was going to be sexually attracted to the opposite gender .
20785 yeah and the pope doesnt abuse children
20786 fuck you why dont you move to another country asshole
20787 cant wait until we buy van dijk in the summer .
20788 i like how elizabeth may spelled it out , should n't dare speak a word like that !
20789 wow i do n't know that people owe up to this on student loan , well i 'm attending a public university
20790 thank goodness they had the protective blue cover over the springs .
20791 only non-whites can rap .
20792 printscrn , learn to use it
20793 good people do n't smoke they drink scotch and beat their wives .
20794 until they find out exactly what made notes explode , no one is safe .
20795 spectra
20796 the headline is misleading , if you read the full quote he 's essentially saying that no religion should completely disown its extremists .
20797 that , and line breaks .
20798 what do you normally do ?
20799 idk i do n't really like puns
20800 found the xim4 user
20801 do n't break both your arms if you live at home

20807 too bad that i ca n't run ow now i can play evie for the whole weekend
20808 are you still taking character requests ?
20809 sounds like we should be giving guns to everyone else to keep the cops safe from eachother .
20810 sooo ... bvs
20811 as opposed to the `` internal pain '' aisle , which happens to be the alcohol department .
20812 cutter clearly was n't a pro , he could have easily forced his way in there with some forward acceleration .
20813 i keep forgetting that when rest of the world freezes australia heats up .
20814 how did you get all the piece of the soul key and unlock the urn without anyone having found the second piece yet ?
20815 yes they will , and they 'll continue to provide more .
20816 oooooh i member
20817 2rspeople
20818 but it says hd on it !
20819 * while i agree , i sometimes make exceptions .
20820 i bet you spend more money on hair products then you did on the yeezys
20821 the night race always has a lot of hype each year but the actual race is pretty boring , i wo n't miss it if it 's gone .

21829 these idiotic groups need to learn the fundamental law of the internet : do not feed the troll .
21830 and then the icc admits it 's utterly toothless , and that there 's nothing it could do if charges were brought except fret and issue stern letters .

23393 free 27 legends pack coming right to you~
23394 should of called him for flopping
23395 why is there a comma in the title though ?
23396 throwing a single piece of paper on the ground is obviously more offensive and unlawful than choking a child .
23397 this is america , idiots with a twitter soapbox have gone as far as the presidency
23398 race to the third-world !
23399 why , it 's almost as if his goal is the exact opposite of reconciliation !

23414 well , what they refer to as `` fake news '' is a threat to their career and the ideology they push , so it * is * a bigger threat to * them * then terrorism ( or crazed lorries ) .
23415 since someone posted that 3 weeks ago or something , i am sure some diligent cig artist is already tracing right over it for an ursa rover commercial
23416 i do n't think i 'll ever be able to take this brewery seriously after 1 ) the kickstarter and 2 ) how much they put cincinnati stuff in despite being based in blue ash of all places .
23417 never heard this idea before !
23418 yeah for a political party that has repeatedly opposed abortion by claiming that a fetus has a soul , that has denied climate change , that has promoted creationism in public schools and has opposed gay marriage because of the bible , they sure seem fund of `` facts and logic '' .
23419 scarier than the actual game
23420 but it also causes autism so choose wisely !
23421 we have the best * legal * immigrants , do n't we folks ?

24730 the old `` we investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong '' approach in this case it 's ok .
24731 its interesting that it kind of points out that hillary running for senate may have been part of the reason he lost to bush
24732 well , what about the rest of the bullshit that 's in that paper ?
24733 somewhere , in soviet russia
24734 and this probably has no impact on the rising cost of housing in the boston area .
24735 ditto .
24736 stable guy like that , ca n't imagine why his ex would n't want him to have custody of their daughter .
24737 williams hijacking fi 's aston martin deal confirmed .
24738 happy to know he is having so much `` fun . ''
24739 do n't worry , every decooling of west-russia relations post-ussr ended up in a word brawl and even worse relations than before .
24740 nah , that 's just the scout scorpion .... they left this in as an easter egg so that when they release the actual card people will think its cool
24741 mfw my msi 980 was 650 euros and still costs 600 at the store .. feels bad man

24762 can you explain the fatlogic in this ?
24763 interesting that 'sly grogging ' is a thing and that the article make no mention of those two huge bags of dope .

24784 i love rondo , probably my favorite non-cs player , but this quote is gold .
24785 such a ladka response
24786 im going to break rule number one but yeah i prefer to work the money ff that accept the money from a child
24787 just anti-israel , not anti-semitic , right ?
24788 looks princess sized to me
24789 the last one was so random xd
24790 shit like this will only go away if people stop patronizing these sites .
24791 this has happened because mudiji is no more the cm of gujrat

24797 i might seek out the odds for the lib dems to be the second largest party in the next parliament .
24798 i removed the fz09 decal from mine in order to not be lumped in with all those hooligans !

24831 [ rip mechonis ]
24832 that is why there are city ordinances against building too close to an airport .
24833 this pc stuff is getting out of control .
24834 seems like a happy bunny .
24835 i think this might have been handled more appropriately through a barbaric cultural practices hotline .
24836 just like the auto aim on consoles .
24837 lets see the un send troops to mosul .
24838 cancer

24859 this will certainly help to alleviate racial tensions .
24860 i ca n't wait to hear about this kids life as she grows up
24861 shouldve let him get 8 , bert .
24862 darude sandstorm
24863 abandon all hope , ye who enter these comments
24864 who 's going to invent the reef-o-lizer ?
24865 obviously it 's because the ussr hated pinochet 's freedom and democracy .
24866 velocilobster returns
24867 damn bikers riding all over the place .
24868 berry 's tackle of stevie johnson was so good - payback bitch
24869 wtf was he vaping gasoline ?

24874 top ten watchmojo videos

24876 maybe she 's blind and could n't see the bag .

24879 stop your whining and get mo armour
24880 anyone know the game being played here ?
24881 it does n't now - what he is saying is that one day , such a machine will exist and when it does , they will consider allowing women in the temple .
24882 in their defense , they 're probably on their cell phone and typing on their laptop while steering the car with their knee , so they do n't really have a hand free for the turn signal .
24883 gramer mistekas
24884 oh , you must be uneducated then .
24885 he was doing a back-to-back with the florists on a wednesday-thursday binge .
24886 good vibrations , obviously
24887 bought for 1.5 billion , sold for 465 million ..... what a great deal !
24888 this definitely happened .
24889 yeah i sure wish the powers at be in my country would get their shit together and start telling me what i can and ca n't believe in
24890 yeah because fuck religious freedom right guys !
24891 which obviously worked right ?
24892 not so much about the game itself as about his experience at tottenham yesterday .
24893 headline is misleading - he would allow electric cars to use the lanes .
24894 faith is what allows people to fly planes into buildings and suicide bomb innocent victims ... but your faith is different than theirs right carly ?
24895 i do n't think anyone has considered survivor series part of the `` big 4 '' since it stopped being an important ppv years ago and was almost cut out completely .
24896 hes wearing armor , he is alright .
24897 he drives like i do in grand theft auto .
24898 this is why we need to teach more abstention instead of sex ed
24899 yeah well i can order dominos pizza from an app , suck it grandpa
24900 bet a happy holidays would have pissed her off just as much .
24901 love how hes giving away his awp as of a day ago seems like he mighta seen it coming : d
24902 op , look around you right now ... what fraction the items you own were constructed from scratch by you ?

24911 but you ca n't be sexist against men !
24912 i 'm done with the fantastic 4 .
24913 i 'd love some cloning glasses .
24914 `` codsworth loved that . ''
24915 this is awesome , u got talent : ) ca n't stop looking at it
24916 good song shit video
24917 but no then all the job creators will flee the country !
24918 the guy in the original thread talked about him being better for the national team , which fits being the nations greatest a bit better .
24919 is it time to sign chris crocker again ?
24920 i have this sad feeling that today you would not have to look hard to find a similar game but with guys in turbans .
24921 all i need to do is save up
24922 let 's see if the media calls this a `` clash '' or a `` fracas '' like they did when trump supporters beat a protester at one of his rallies .
24923 just to be clear : unlike most infographics posted here with accurate data but presented horribly , this is completely fabricated data .
24924 well at least we got an impartial opinion .
24925 star tribune really providing serious objectively and journalistic integrity .
24926 everyone hates the episode and the songs but idk why
24927 g_g , can confirm , good sandwiches are pretty fucking good .
24928 how misinformed must one be to believe that going to a woman-hating band of barbarians is a good idea , when one already enjoys a comfortable life in a western country ?
24929 christ i ca n't wait until he starts taking credit for all of this
24930 the san bernardino shooters said things like `` allah '' , `` kafir '' , and `` jihad '' in the moments before the shooting .
24931 just wait five years until he jumps ship for health problems and comes to ohio state .
24932 because there is two tits , and one prostate .
24933 `` i dunno , is starting a conversation like a normal goddamn human being something * you * would consider doing ? ''
24934 i also move that criminals should be referred to as `` people who committed a crime , '' or at the least `` amazing people who 've fallen on hard times , but everyone 's a special flower , unless they 're white ''
24935 all i 've learned about trump supporters from this discussion is that apparently they do n't care about the president having any knowledge of , or plan for , well , anything ... as long as they tell it like it is or something ... troubling .
24936 no , never
24937 pretty obvious marin is going to fnc right ?

26174 lots of white supremacists use such terms as `` in da hood , '' constantly .
26175 not even 1st edition !

26183 but trump held a rainbow flag once and told caitlyn jenner she could pee in whatever bathroom she wants at his building so clearly he 's the biggest friend of the gays ever !
26184 obviously the only reason you did n't immediately say yes is because you just did n't see the message
26185 she looks like she belongs in a john hughes movie .

26199 every now and then , right as a person is about to be hit , you should force their head to turn ingame to face whatever is about to hit them .
26200 it just shows how tired trump supporters are of politicians and their bat shit crazy supporters !
26201 i 'm sure this research will get funding under a trump adminstration !
26202 trump is more likely to give federal funding to a line that takes people out of the country .
26203 with that much gamma you could transform into the hulk at anytime .
26204 `` this is when it get scary ''

28084 ahhhh now i feel stupid
28085 what are you asking ?
28086 to be fair , i doubt either a overhyped subreddit or publicly accessible datamining tools existed for the game during the prime of its life .
28087 til it 's not a foul if your intent was n't to give the opponent a concussion
28088 we 're fucked

28130 not to piss on the party or anything , but , his travel restriction will be reinstated ... this is just delaying it ... but it 's completely constitutional so it 's obviously going to stand ... but our legal system allows for you to heavily delay things like so .
