0 and we 're upset since the democrats would * never * try something as sneaky as this , right ?
1 til , voluntary slavery by starving people who 'd work for food can 'potentially virtually ' wipe out unemployment
2 that 'd be great if only ron paul was n't a christian !
3 but , but ... lowering taxes creates jobs !
4 whores !
5 well , yeah , but his plan would funnel money to job creators so they can store it safely until they 're ready to make a job for one of those guys maybe .
6 file under `` how the right wing wants to keep government smaller and out of your business . ''
7 he has great respect for the office .
8 i like romney 's advice better - `` borrow from your folks '' .
9 just another responsible gun owner excercising his rights under the 2nd amendment .
10 what oil spill ?
11 it 's a city built on debts and booze ... probably .
12 cause the whole system is rigged .
13 thank god congress is there to look out for our best interests despite what the majority wants !
14 i have to deal with 64 all the time .
15 was he shootin ' at some food ?
16 but we can just go to the er , they have to tape us back together .
17 guys ... guys i know the answer ... lets ... double down on our policy and inject tons of money into our failed program !
18 * * i do n't remember saying anything about this * * + also is n't the whole idea is of up-voting is to get this stupid message out to the masses ?
19 -pope francis
20 wooooow this is the first positive thing my state has been in the news for in quite a while .
21 it almost sounds like they are accusing the cia of being less-than-forthright about their methods ... i find this hard to believe
22 its not like the people voted on it or anythin
23 things like this make me wonder if nature secretly understands irony .
24 oh no , please saint elizabeth , only you can save america from the evil hillary who is personally responsible for everything wrong with the world .
25 when rw is complaining about their own party - maybe someone in the gop will listen - i 'm guessing not .
26 thats cool i hate to gop too !
27 three strikes and the constitution is out .
28 because , obama
29 there goes obummer again stomping on small business trying to tell that what to do !
30 shouldnt we be discussing sony and nk ?
31 well that 's a shock !
32 their spin machine is too worn out from over use .
33 you have been invited to mod 8chan
34 yeah , why ca n't those stupid * * * * * * just shut up like they 're supposed to ?
35 so people almost lost their homes over 40 dollars of pot ?
36 just more proof that the republican party is a wholly owned puppet of the koch brothers , and similarly oily ilk .
37 two faces , two corinthians .
38 she clearly struggles to connect coherent thought into words .
39 he 's muslim ?
40 this is clearly a vast right wing conspiracy to discredit her for perfectly ordinary and acceptable fees
41 yea but then it would put the health insurance companies out of business and that means job losses .
42 but bernie is attacking her everyday and trying to destroy her .
43 bernie should say : `` enough is enough , '' which is a magical incantation that has a real world effect on people .
44 what a crook
45 but they `` won '' iowa and nh is next to vermont .. and they 're about to be saved by the hispanic and african-american voters .. why fire people on the verge of their triumph ?
46 i guess it gets lonely in the closet
47 the sanders scare : be afraid , be very afraid .
48 and that 's why i 'm voting republican .
49 yeaaah ... that 's gon na hurt sanders ...
50 because exactly the same people are commenting from that time .
51 since when is the daily caller a legitimate news source ?
52 what could possibly go wrong ?
53 i 'm so sad that i decided to play video games instead of watching this mess .
54 they should have to wear a star and crescent on their arm so we know who they are .
55 just another outlier .
56 this was an oddly phrased tittle : my thoughts
57 til trump is an anti-semite
58 i 'm officially an atheist now .
59 i 'm not really a fan of any of the candidates , but i ca n't believe people seriously want trump as president , completely insane choice .
60 because no one is representing their interests .
61 i 'm sure he 's just warning the good people of nevada about the judo-bolshevik conspiracy .
62 i still ca n't believe how funny it is that sanders got the only white naacp president to endorse him .
63 pretty sure they could use the money they 're wasting on the wall instead of the meager foreign aid .
64 the national review has been so dead on with their predictions about trump that i am sure this one would work .
65 the one that stays in its 'free speech zone ' three counties away from the politician they 're protesting ?
66 looks like they 're paying for the wall .
67 good news for people who love small government and local rights .
68 just a fresh load of bits and bytes , encapsulated for convenience .
69 reddit `` no she 's not , here 's this shit poll conducted on buzzfeed that says sanders is winning ''
70 yeah hi i wrote the quick story you 're linking to , if you could refrain from putting racist quotes in my mouth that 'd be so great .
71 his voting record shows this , reddit does n't care .
72 oh another anti-hillary story on reddit , how shocking .
73 thanks for showing me the light , oliver !
74 that 's it , i 'm voting for bernie !
75 sadly , hiding under beds scared of dark bogeymen is at an alltime high among republican voters .
76 guys do n't forget it was only about illegal immigrants
77 i do n't know why trump keeps attacking obama , it 's not like he can be convicted of treason , because he 's not even an american citizen .
78 but it 's okay , everyone , hillary was the one that wanted more war .
79 she also visited the white house many times and spoke with obama !
80 if only all these violations actually meant anything other than headline fodder .
81 i 'm sure this poll is 100 % accurate and in no way slanted .
82 i 'm sure she responsibly put the documents in a sealed envelope , handed them to an aide and said , `` make sure you keep that close to your vest , '' while winking in a pronounced fashion .
83 where are the left-wing billionaires ?
84 how does this make america great again ?
85 but i thought he was such a revolutionary !
86 i 'm sure he reached this conclusion after thoroughly studying evidence .
87 looks like angie knows her place .
88 god i 'm so sick of democrats making our country so much more partisan .
89 yeah but it 's not fair for hillary to get them since trump never attended his
90 the best people
91 its all part of his 153-d chess strategy to bring those numbers down so low that when there is a 1-month minor spurt he can claim how great he is at it .
92 does this stuff really sell newspapers ?
93 i 'm so upset over this .
94 does n't pretty much every service provider on the web sell your data ?
95 yeah but why would we listen to physicians ?
96 huffington post is a well respected and reputable source for all things .
97 `` there 's no varmit poontang like dead varmit poontang ... i always say . ''
98 a litmus test of proper whiteness ?
99 only on the jews , but hey , they do n't really count , right ?
100 somewhere clinton watts is smirking .
101 americans should totally be more gung ho to squeeze even more productivity gains out of themselves so they can not be compensated for it and see 95 % of economic gains go to the wealthiest 1 % of the population .
102 alabama , congratulations on moving forward to 1979 and best of luck with that cultural revolution .
103 well , that 's ok , just so long as he keeps funding the affordable care act !
104 tell me how you really feel
105 when in rome ?
106 yeah all the videos of people in hospitals we saw are all fake and paid actors .
107 ummmm , awesome !
108 good for him , it 's a really nice place .
109 if the moab does n't rally the country and distract them from this , then maybe nuking north korea will ?
110 it 's just a coincidence i 'm sure !
111 the music just hides the sounds of furious mastrubation and teary climax from the panel .
112 i may not like em , but at least he is going somewhere relevant .
113 i 'm sure the right would love to bring corporate regulation back to what it was in the founders ' day .
114 they 're not lobbyists if they 're on your side .
115 strange because it does n't work in any other first world countries .
116 it 's quite remarkable how all the checks and balances and power abuse laws turned out to be duds once they were actually put to test .
117 as a democrat l can say his first 100 days are a success .
118 what a shocker
119 seattle ... continuing to do it right : )
120 thanks to viagra
121 this is fake news because we all know trump is a warrior for free speech and free expression
122 oh no , that sucks .
123 they had the most beautiful chocolate cake
124 and the hilarity continues .......
125 magas
126 hahahahaha motor city mad man and grizzly mom siiiiiiick burn bro that was fucking epic !
127 no , just lynching skills
128 nationalizing whole industries like the energy sector work so well , right
129 using the new congressional line of thinking , they have `` access '' to live somewhere else , so why not just leave ?
130 but he did n't offer him a beautiful piece of chocolate cake ?
131 nobody knew being president could be so complicated .
132 trump has cut out the middle-men that past administrations have used as their buffer between them and the media , and instead he convenes with the media directly , saving tax dollars !
133 nice of politico to cut off her response ensuring fair balance .
134 he carried the russian vote , this is fake news
135 wtf reddit , always trying to blame trump for obama 's mistakes
136 yeah no shit
137 but but but the other day fox was saying this was 95 % ..... i do n't know who i should believe
138 now maybe they can get to the bottom of all that obama spying on trump .
139 do people honestly believe watters should lose his job for this joke ?
140 well , what business was it of the reporter 's ?
141 * that damn putin told me being president would be just like being on the apprentice *
142 the republican party , the most dangerous , ideologically bankrupt organization in human history
143 why does it matter , he was just an unpaid intern that trump never even met
144 the ever reliable and unbiased `` trump hired hookers to piss on obama 's mattress '' news source : buzzfeed
145 this is not about test scores ... this is about profits .
146 i bet a lot less people would apathetic if less retirees were in congress telling younger people they do n't matter .
147 but then it 's obama 's fault for not vetting pence properly !
148 yeah , it just works out so badly for the average worker in those countries .
149 i 'll bet they are racists and hate black people just like all the rest of the republicans .
150 yellowcakewalk , where have you been amigo ?
151 huffpo denounces capitalism ?
152 yes , the massive standing norwegian army is going to take over .
153 the article was n't biased at all .
154 contempt of court ?
155 why is anyone shocked when a guy referred to as an etch-a-sketch by his own campaign staff changes his position ?
156 i would love to have this as a question during the presidential debate .
157 yes we can !
158 oh please we want to hear more of their fear and hate mongering and lies , we especially want more lies .
159 indeed , bring back the unionized refs .
160 really classy guy .
161 * allegedly *
162 hey america , if you 're nervous about terrorists , how about you start meeting their demands instead of bombing their home countries .
163 much better than drinking too much , being sick off your ass and feeling like shit all the next day or ya know dying .
164 should n't that read 92 % of congress claims to be christians .
165 but do n't forget that both parties are the same .
166 did bush 's grandaddy bank for obama too ?
167 telling you now gop : do the exact opposite of what this guy says and you might have a chance .
168 you know what would fix that ... scrapping inheritance taxes ... thanks gop
169 was that the deportable that gop fuck wit was talking about ?
170 i 'm sure its a coincidence .
171 given two corpses , one is bound to look a little more lifelike .
172 wow what a hero
173 explanation for the low voter turn out on the democratic side right here
174 well once they started shaming middle class white males .... im not surprised they lost many of their votes .
175 good thing all those voter id laws got passed to prevent machines from changing your vote .
176 yeah and martin o'malley should be energy secretary
177 but nate silver underestimated trump , so clearly nothing he says can ever be trusted again .
178 as culturally latino as taco bell .
179 if only a portion of these 45,000 petitioners took initiative to actually vote instead of do their usual and complain .
180 jeez oh man , looks like i need a new candidate .
181 sounds like a great marriage .
182 but when someone says bernie 's free college for all is just not possible , it gets down-voted to oblivion .
183 bye shitbag .
184 how do you think trump must feel ?
185 ah , the age old christian values of discrimination ... christ would be so pleased .
186 this is a sexist article .
187 i demand that sanders release his speeches to castro .
188 the only reason she 's supporting clinton apparently is 'she has the right genitalia , and bernie is too old ' what a rational thought out reason to vote for someone
189 megyn kelly is gon na be there ?
190 you mean `` misremembering ''
191 yeah , its getting out of control , and if these protesters actually have to face real world consequences for their actions , it will thin the herd considerably normally i would say just kick them out , but its just gone beyond acceptable , and its getting even worse start arresting them , let them know if you break the law , you face the consequences
192 but he 's not electable !
193 massachusetts regrets voting for her
194 but the mainstream media told me that trump is the worst out of all the candidates , and he is the one responsible for the bad image the republican party , and ted cruz does n't have anyone like david duke endorsing him , just kevin swanson
195 who gives a shit
196 to be fair the presidential election is the only thing that matters for them in north carolina after the congressional districts were ~~racially segregated~~ * gerrymandered *
197 i 'm sure this is a great moral victory for bernie that will propel him to beat hillary
198 we iz legion we r annonymoose
199 i think it 's time we give a nickname to trump 's 'voice in his head '
200 great , the last thing i need to see on tv is elijah cummings bitching about shit .
201 top lel
202 til the millions of people who voted for sanders are all beta-male college kid stoners who still use bean bags .
203 they 're at shea and pallisades which is actually pretty close to the mayo clinic hospital ( 4 mins away and shea is one of the few ways to get there ) that said , the side of the road that drivers would be taking to get to the hospital campus from the other side of the protest appears to be mostly open .
204 shutdown capitalism too !
205 us this before or after obama takes all our guns , and declare himself emperor
206 by being the single most divisive politician next to darnold dump in the country
207 big shock
208 the sad part is that most cruz supporters will enthusiastically support this crap .
209 why would anyone distrust a government ?
210 cross between wallace and perot .
211 definitely explains merkel .
212 she is such a piece of garbage
213 i think the election should be about policy ...
214 a giant roach motel with a big , beautiful door .
215 if the media did that she 'd pay them less
216 i 'm sure this applies to corporate welfare recipients too
217 the way god intended !
218 fat chicks are usually pretty witty .
219 so when are we gon na riot and fucking take this country back ?
220 i truly believe this who ordeal has been caused by the selfishness of the
221 what is it with you reality-based people and your obsession with `` facts '' ?
222 what a tremendously well-written and unbiased article .
223 but they still have the backing of billionaires and the m $ m .
224 if he had his way : abortions would be illegal , creationism taught in schools , and no environmental regulations .
225 if they want a good education then their parents should n't have made bad life choices , maybe they should get a job and pay for their own socialistic education .
226 too bad a lot of us can not vote for him for real with all the voter suppression .
227 when jews see you coming running away , you should take the hint .
228 i see the papers , now where are the rules ?
229 they 're called buses and they 're pretty reliable .
230 i 'm sure he thought thus up all by himself and acted alone .
231 he is actually part irish .
232 i am sick to death of these posts time and time again just so you can get front page karma whoring
233 if we could only stamp out sin completely we 'd never have bad weather again .
234 and received an 8 % return !
235 will they give us back our money then ?
236 as a married woman , it astounds me that any other woman would marry any of these nimrods who need those instructions on how to talk to our gender with the respect they expect for themselves .
237 i am sure they were working real hard to catch terrorist
238 it 's increasingly more of a spectacle than an information source .
239 yes , but it does n't involve shaming women or scaring teens , so it does n't count .
240 obama is making me pay for your prostituting child .
241 maybe not , but it 's a very good first step .
242 sensationalization in progress : 5-year-old suspended for hand gun .
243 it 's ok , black people ca n't be racist , only whites can .
244 yes and never mind that christians drink * while in church * , they also happen to have the least drunk countries in the world ...
245 could some one compare the proposed law against dangerous bikes against wyoming laws for guns ?
246 not the first time alabama found a way to deny a people of a civil right .
247 is this only for one state , or the whole usa ?
248 i do n't want to live in a world where a nice white guy ca n't make sweeping generalizations loaded with casual racism and not get away with it !
249 yeah , cuz fuck democracy right ?
250 thats right ... thats why we just saw a rachel maddow loving atheist kill 3 muslims over a parking space ... because he wasnt religious or right wing , it wasnt a hate crime ... it was the right wing that rioted and burned down a town and had one of its supporters kill 2 nyc policemen ... what was the last `` right wing '' domestic terrorist act ?
251 those fleet-footed urban youth are at it again , it seems , trying to thief our war dollars for `` food . ''
252 really surprises me that this kindof behavior is happening in chicago
253 the fox news propaganda machine is working as planned ... buwahahahahaha !
254 better call in some air strikes .
255 unemployment is at 5 percent .
256 they usually vote the wrong way anyways .
257 yep , and we all know what direction that 's going in
258 yeah , because all trump supporters are white
259 she 's just like us !
260 it 's her turn sexist !
261 pretty much bill .
262 what is every one bitching about , those were made in america bombs .
263 lol yeah , because this is a super important issue !
264 what a shock
265 fucking blue state commie socialists
266 we need a redheaded quadrapelegic who was left handed who is genderfluid .
267 she made a boo-boo ?
268 yeah , but only white people read time .
269 what a truly despicable thing to say !
270 mods please remove this .... it clearly is n't political
271 yeah , but he blew her the fuck out in the debate and going to the vatican will win him all the catholic votes since that 's how catholics function so he 's going to win new york easily .
272 no pictures of the 'crowd ' eh .
273 he 's a millennial , obviously .
274 because they had to * stand in line *
275 i 'll laugh at this when trump wins .
276 the low voter turnout has to be because so many sanders ballots were `` lost '' right ?
277 but anyone who notices is just a pie in the sky berni bot who doesnt know how the 'real world ' works so its fine .
278 supporters understand that he does not have real shot , this is no longer about just him .
279 til joe 's into pegging .
280 women do n't know what common sense or reason are .
281 just `` new york '' values again ...
282 \ # thankshillary
283 well .... nothing involving my state and the governor is ever good .
284 considering that so much voter suppression and election fraud is at play nationwide , especially in poor areas , this is not surprising by any means .
285 but remember , its the bernie supporters that are the problem !
286 i suppose this is called dirty politics .
287 this is great news for sanders !
288 cruz , after a late night binge-watching the blues brothers , announces , `` we 're on a mission from god '' sorta
289 anybody that has molested a child in any given time day or life should be fed to 1,000 wolves and i wouldnt even want the wolves to get sick !
290 since this is russian propaganda and not american i guess she has done nothing wrong .
291 it 's like if i read your comment , punched myself in the eye out of rage and then held you accountable .
292 but i thought money bought elections , which is why we need to get rid of citizen 's united ?
293 is it just me , or has sputnik news really upped the quality of content submission around here ?
294 interesting one ... i want to see the answers on this one .
295 yeah but is n't it only a side effect of them attempting to benefit themselves ?
296 fox `` news '' sure is good at finding black people who hate white people .
297 yay for editorialized headline .
298 but we have lots of body scanners and big brother is watching us ever so closely to keep us safe .
299 an parody becomes even more difficult in the world of the republican .
300 the car 's on fire and there 's no driver at the wheel
301 jon kyl was not intended to be a factual statement
302 what 's wrong with trainspotting license plates ?
303 this makes sense , since the middle class having more money act as the job destroyers .
304 military must be full of kooks .
305 i find this thread to be full of anti-semitism !
306 i always think it 's cute when liberals try to act like they care about soldiers or how they 're treated .
307 obviously the republican leadership is more generous in helping the less than fortunate democrats in their counties than those managed by democrats .
308 this should just be treason .
309 yeah , the royal family are so powerful it 's such a scandal that they exist .
310 it 's a governmental conspiracy to force us all into marriage .
311 if he wants a recount , he 's going to have to pay for it .
312 who knew outsourcing your campaign 's it jobs to the geek squad would end so badly ?
313 do these people even realize that the red states , their audience , are the prime users of food stamps .
314 it 's really rich , for him to be so sneeringly dismissive of the idea of the gop breaking ranks when you 've got gopers coming right out and announcing that they 're breaking ranks .
315 i kinda agree with this , if you need to get rid of a building and nobody is willing to demolish it , then allowing people to play with fireworks indoors is n't all that crazy .
316 pnac
317 a lot of people are not doctors .
318 after the fifth different girl with an untreated yeast infection .
319 bankruptcy and limited liability better not protect these negligent criminals from prosecution .
320 the corrupt ncaa cartel needs someone to fight them and their obscene profits .
321 i do n't blame cruz for being a real life elmer gantry , i blame the idiots who voted for his dumb ass .
322 the nsa and fisc are james clapper 's accomplices .
323 america , starting to make parts of the third world look good !
324 it would have to be a legitimate rape tho
325 finally , someone to bring some reason and class to the gop field .
326 because forcing people to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich is fair .
327 some believe these new activities would consist of ... being lazy .
328 oh my god , the huffington post has n't reported on this yet !
329 maybe he saw a picture of the cameraman being rescued .
330 that 's 2 things too many !
331 uh-oh
332 bernie needs to bring his supporters to heel !
333 bernie said it so it must be true !
334 he ( and you ) must have read `` games people play '' .
335 thankfully congress is controlled by the democrats
336 yup ... trump is certainly to the left of hillary
337 98 % of the tweets from bernie bros
338 found the shill !
339 what about his free speech rights ?
340 nice to see those abstinence-only programs are finally paying off .
341 not republican , and not democrat .
342 `` clinton adversary '' oh , so an impartial observer !
343 oh , but i thought that there was n't any evidence at all and they were just about to drop the whole thing !
344 haha shit just got real !
345 you 'll get clinton 's transcripts when trump is damn good and ready to release them !
346 its alright he know what he 's doing , he 's rich !
347 because sarah palin knows all about winning .
348 obama kept the bush tax cuts in place for everyone that makes $ 400,000 and less , and that did not happen till 2013 , but such facts will not stop the blinded from repeating the falsehood of `` 8 years of tax increases ''
349 i was just thinking , i wonder what never-have-been redditors have to say .
350 because she was asked about the dealings of the clinton foundation .
351 the centipede brigade is busy today .
352 so they have to poll at 15 % in 5 different polls , when most polls do n't even bother having a 3rd party option , yeah not rigged at all
353 that 's sexist
354 bullets are cheaper anyway
355 a real woodrow wilson that trump .
356 then why are all the californians moving to austin ?
357 kansas is probably the best and most obvious example of how trickle-down economics destroy the country .
358 because kentucky is such a crucial battleground state
359 because saying that you will do something does n't mean you should then do it .
360 we 've been giving the supply side of the economy breaks on breaks on breaks for decades , but anything giving a break to the demand side of the economy is `` an absolute disaster for our economy . ''
361 so what , ditsy broad
362 she is so evil how can anyone vote for her
363 countdown until crooked hillary is indicted and diamond joe enters the race .
364 i 'm not trump supporter but i 'm pretty sure politifucked is about as impartial as the jury in `` to kill a mockingbird ''
365 at this point i would rather volunteer for the trump campaign than vote for hillary .
366 it 's simple , keep your word .
367 i hope they are all going through background checks like we do here .
368 more non-pie-in-the-sky , real-world observations from bernie .
369 right wing conspiracies .
370 she is only being singled out because of her gender .
371 but that does n't prove he was n't qualified .
372 i 'm sure she will get right on that .
373 the fec rules are just a right-wing conspiracy .
374 someone learned them the hard way in '08 .
375 `` university ''
376 by rigging things in her favor , i assume .
377 if only they had murdered more people , maybe communism would have worked this time !
378 she does n't * need * nj , plebes ^
379 yeah that sounds legit .
380 is n't `` jew-hating anti-semite '' redundant ?
381 americans could have saved the money to buy bullets to kill more muslim in middle-east
382 foxnews did not say so , so it is not true
383 this guy 's getting desperate .
384 so why are n't they buying robots from china then ?
385 and after that , we can just make knives really expensive .
386 how come those who refer to others as 'gun nuts ' are often the most fanatical bunch ?
387 well , someone has to create those jobs , do n't they ?
388 good
389 pansy
390 not everything is a conspiracy dude , we 're not ready to believe you .
391 someday rich white people will overcome this bigotry .
392 it 's definitely not mental health of individuals .
393 but there 's a `` war on christmas '' out there started by them dang godless liberal commies !
394 because smart people with funds will be able to convince others of something especially when they have time and no opposition .
395 at the risk of sounding crass ... in curious to see how quickly the gop restores the cuts since they ended up hurting a corporations profits .
396 think of how much money could have been saved if they had only made a run to mcdonalds for state dinners with visiting heads of state .
397 2 parties are the same
398 and so much freedom was accomplished .
399 and minnesota just keeps gaining
400 she 's still a thing ?
401 i 'm still blown away that the party of `` personal freedoms '' and `` lack of government intervention '' are the people who think government should make people criminals for using something put here by their white judeo-christian god .
402 good thing that war in iraq magically paid for itself with oil or something .
403 lets hope he can some day reach the level of respect as the previous administration
404 i am going out on a limb and guessing that this is what happens when the federal government has a shit ton of military equipment that is no longer in use overseas and the local police needs cheap vehicles for events that require something more than a normal squad car .
405 especially a plant god created
406 but netanyahu says the deal will threaten israel 's survival , he 's never wrong !
407 you do n't support going to war , you do n't support the troops .
408 if you want to see your incomes stop falling you should call your representative and oppose the expansion of h1-b visas which are driving down wages .
409 yeah but their freedom rate is at an all time low
410 use credible sources .
411 well cool , now they can cut what 's left of welfare to make up for the tax loss .
412 not while there are people with crohn 's disease using pot as medicine to imprison !
413 on one hand , it 's very pathetic and quite horrifying that the majority of children born to women under 30 are in single parent households , on the other , this is a very wrong-headed attempt to try to deal with that issue .
414 also said that he reads playboy for the articles and they do n't pollute to increase bottom-line , putting all that pollution out in the world is its own reward .
415 remember plebes , your vote matters !
416 impeach obama !
417 lol , wnd .
418 no shit .
419 hopefully this will prove to be true , once he has melania on the first-lady track .
420 obviously , because it 's just trump pointing out how easily our politicians are for sale .
421 katy perry is not gay .
422 but she did n't do it intentionally so it 's ok .
423 i wonder which half .
424 trump loves slavery .
425 secret service agent found dead from apparent suicide
426 snowden should be completely investigated and all of the facts should come out before we pass judgement .
427 richard dawkins - loved him on family fued
428 clearly because she 's innocent .
429 but if i type in `` gary johnson beats trump and clinton '' into google , i 've got dozens of polls saying otherwise !
430 well , the media sure pushed that story .. what a surprise !
431 but those tax breaks for corporations will trickle down
432 what does judge joe brown have to say ?
433 but she said there would be no more shoes to drop from the fbi .
434 this attitude is a good reason for kicking the most hardcore supporters of bernie out of the democratic party .
435 no one cares , vote for who you want to vote for .
436 because the gop is n't known for bigotry and discrimination .
437 well it 's good that a low-key , quiet-spoken celebrity known for being even-tempered and logical is supporting trump .
438 emails about drone strikes sent to ~~clinton 's personal email~~ everyone who was watching hillary 's very public server .
439 `` what difference does it make ? ! ''
440 just another low-information black voter !
441 i can think of a few names
442 if trump had said this every station would be talking about it lmao
443 wait ... who is buying guns with no questions asked ?
444 50 people shooting in a dark , packed club while drinking would have made this a much better situation .
445 blaming shit on video games , music , movies , or tv shows is the height of stupidity .
446 why do we even allow civilians to have armor ?
447 in other news , donald trump 's comments about women become increasingly aggressive .
448 she learned a valuable lesson about power .
449 say hello to your future king .
450 our knight in shining bronzer .
451 they directly asked for $ 1.00 donations and removed the thousands of huge donations and create this number for one month , also the line that rewrote headline is from mentions `` according to the campaign '' oh yea seems legit .
452 he bought paper from dunder miflinn
453 that traitor .
454 how many liberals was that ?
455 i think john lewis should get to beat his ass .
456 if we elected people based on being qualified we would have never elected a jr senator !
457 maybe we should rely on our own rational thought to come to the conclusion that he 's a dick and clueless ?
458 big fucking deal * jerk off motion *
459 yeah , because that 's how geopolitics works .
460 she 's already testified .
461 clearly he meant something horrifically racist that just curdles the blood of anyone who actually hears it .
462 no one saw that coming
463 he was lied to .
464 yes it would be a big deal - get your head out of the left right paradigm and start asking yourself if as an american it 's wrong or right .
465 i noticed that the comments were closed at that website .
466 i do n't want to live on this planet anymore .
467 see , the free market always makes the right choice .
468 this is why we need to get rid of the epa and let the free market handle things .
469 this is horrible because without vawa violence against women becomes legal and socially acceptable .
470 making texas proud !
471 we do n't need no fucking arab socialist preaching anything .
472 sounds like they feel that boy has gotten a little uppity .
473 so much circle jerking going on in this thread .
474 oh ya the feds will definitely get right on that
475 ah yes , another article super relevant to today 's current events .
476 no , i believe that would be the republicans that excel at saying things divorced from reality , aka `` making shit up . ''
477 we definitely need more intelligent comments like these .
478 i hope this shuts up everyone who thinks southerners are a bunch of trigger-happy idiots who are filled with fear .
479 what a surprise !
480 but , you know , the government does n't create jobs .
481 but they made an * investment * , in lobbying !
482 gee , i wonder if that 's why james clapper did n't get into any trouble for lying to congress
483 `` now ''
484 get a degree : earn a minimum wage job
485 ted cruz advocates special security for hate groups , interesting !
486 how about no .
487 man , the dramatic music and cheap effects sure make this video seem professional and non-conspiratorial
488 while that may be so , there are still troubling and legitimate questions as to why ted cruz wo n't disclose a long form birth certificate .
489 well , that is the christian thing to do .
490 it is ok because that money hidden away in `` social not for profit '' organizations to elect republicans is .... white , of course .
491 newflash - bush has n't been president for years .
492 yeah , but what lesson does that teach these worthless vagrants ?
493 bush 's are never to blame for their failures .
494 she 'll meet with the fbi once everyone else meets with the fbi .
495 i 'm gon na guess this is public and all they say is `` sry we fucked up your campaing ''
496 well since hillary said it , it must be true .
497 because oj simpson was too busy .
498 thought she said it was an interview not in estivation .
499 i wonder if this restaurant owner does
500 she does have the best record of transparency .
501 welcome to the next eight years .
502 watch it walker , you keep saying nice things about hillary and you wo n't get that sweet vp some people think you should get .
503 bernie officially sells out .
504 maybe he should just stop showing up and see if anyone joins him .
505 why should n't women have the same selective service obligations as men ?
506 how can you be against it if it 's all secret
507 thank you republicans , always doing the important work that will impact the lives of the majority of americans .
508 they should have just called them commie schools , be proud of who you are kansas !
509 giuliani must say what `` crime problem '' he 's talking about -- since the crime rate in america has been on the decline for 25 years , and has n't been this low since the 1970s .
510 keep voting for the lesser of two evils people , nothing bad will ever happen !
511 all these trump supporters crying now because they were hoping bernie would throw a wrench into things .
512 misleading title because oh and pa have no black people .
513 zomg so racist
514 maybe blue balls are why they are so violent .
515 i think hillary entertains the thought of losing .
516 geesh , does this sub get anything right ?
517 the fuck do atheists have to do with family life ?
518 fair and balanced as always .
519 if cops is be raycis , how come they 're having a cookout with blm ?
520 whelp ... anyone else for gary johnson , seeings how both major parties have driven off the progressive cliff ?
521 and just like the primaries , the bernie bro 's will fail to show up .
522 cool
523 is bill running for president ?
524 if they hate being poor they will try to make money .
525 ladies and gentlemen , your 2016 democratic party !
526 that 's hot as fuck
527 yeah because it 's only the convention causing this bump and nothing else
528 i dont see how anything in this article proves this .
529 ... and we wonder why she has n't held a press conference since 2015 .
530 hillary victory fund it seems
531 unified party people
532 because it matters so much more than our sick corrupted democracy !
533 sexist much
534 trump has n't even gotten * started * on her .
535 because it 's her turn !
536 i 'm shocked , shocked that a dude who 's been in politics for 30 odd years , but never in the democratic party nor gave the democratic party any support during that time was n't well received with open arms by democrats !
537 this far into the election and she still lacks any brand or message ... it 's vote for me because it 's me ... lame
538 glad to have herman cain 's opinion on the matter .
539 downvote it so it 's not true
540 * unity *
541 weak , ignorant people are easier to control .
542 boy oh * boy * those coming debates with trump will be fun .
543 was n't politico one of the outlets with writers under dnc control/influence ?
544 `` it 's just a prank , bro . ''
545 regardless of your politics , these are some pretty powerful images that tell a story all in themselves .
546 how comforting .
547 if you guys would just vote for her , she 'd show you !
548 that 's what most of the event is comprised of , so yes .
549 pretty sad article : /
550 but ... but ... i thought a corporation was an individual .
551 remember believing something is true makes it true
552 rekt
553 only in america is this an excuse to skip a debate .
554 it 's okay though because it 's her turn .
555 between this and deflate gate espn should have real great content this season .
556 already debunked by politifact sorry spinners
557 he will annex it first , then it already will be part of russia
558 does anyone really believe her ?
559 this is shaping up to be a fantastic week for him .
560 this is why i love living in tampa .
561 thank you , glen beck , rush limbaugh , sean hannity and fox news for contributing your productive and thought provoking citizens to constructive town hall debates about nazi health-care .
562 fox news should be called the back stabbing rat fucking network .
563 yes it is , but ut 's a great way for the wealthy to cull the less desirables .
564 someone give this man a cookie !
565 is your history teacher 's blog reddit ?
566 what is he doing about it then ?
567 is n't this al gore 's new network ?
568 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha fox will never stoop to that wacko idea .
569 it 's the fags fault !
570 yeah , cause auto manufacturers never get sued !
571 more palin derangement syndrome .
572 i do n't have much to say right here except that this makes me happy .
573 tax churches next so we can have uninhibited integration of church and state
574 because anecdotal stories * always * trumps facts which could be found be researching police records .
575 sounds like a good time to gerrymander !
576 damn you obama !
577 gohmert pile ?
578 but it 's all okay because 'independent expenditures ' do n't `` give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption '' .
579 and it 's not even a record .
580 no one saw this coming when he was appointed
581 clearly the solution to this is to elect * more * bible-thumping science-denying republicans , right , american south ?
582 or just lift the cap and be done with it .
583 hey religion caused a massive aids epidemic in indiana when they one down here but at least whores will be forced to suffer !
584 jamie dimon is better than the rest of us , his wealth proves it !
585 i 'm sure this post will rocket to the top !
586 but nowhere does he mention deep sea fishing rights
587 but reaganomics , that 's the good stuff !
588 well people say they want another ronald reagan .... this is probably as close as we will get .
589 why ca n't cnn be unbiased like breitbart ?
590 especially someone who is a billionaire that has n't donated to hillary clinton , what a travesty
591 that is sooooo fucked up
592 so ... ?
593 but he said he had many friends in his presidential speech !
594 rockefeller republican in black face .
595 all billionaires are shills - except for trump , he 's a self-made man
596 trump2016
597 europe is already being flooded with migrants .
598 i 'm sure their bodies have a way to just shut that whole thing down .
599 and what about the people who do n't have a millionaire daddy who will support them financially if they quit ?
600 what happened to his hair ?
601 i thought the gop did n't agree with abortion
602 naw assange is all about transparency , he does n't hand pick these to be political or anything .
603 lol can we keep giving our crazies to the other side ?
604 should we also consider images of the declaration of independence racist because it was written by thomas jefferson , who owned slaves ?
605 * that sounds exactly like what somebody who was trying to rig the election would say ... * ^
606 i would actually honestly pay good money to watch trump chase a feisty little pomeranian around .
607 why is this piece of human trash even getting media attention ?
608 there is such a long tradition of presidential candidates releasing transcripts of their speeches as private citizens .
609 so , if there 's a media blackout , how is it that we can read about it via media ?
610 having an economy that was 90 % oil had nothing to do with it .
611 insurance rates rise ?
612 you mean the same regressive conservative governments installed by the west ?
613 so the media all just get together as one entity and make public statements now ?
614 i 'm sure it 's just ctr paying off the lot of them .
615 get your british spelling out of my american election
616 hey , if you support the 2nd amendment , you 're a white supremacist now .
617 i bet caroline kennedy found the joke particularly hilarious .
618 considering trump was very `` low energy '' at his rally earlier , it 's pretty clear someone talked to him .
619 for a guy who always tells it like it is , he sure needs translated after the fact at lot .
620 only the emails of the dnc hack are important though !
621 trump is the best thing that ever happened to hillary .
622 liberal media bias changed the word `` literally '' to mean literal
623 i 'm bringing the punch .
624 ca n't believe obummer has n't done anything to stop isis .
625 because they were mean to her .
626 o'brian ?
627 3756d quantum galactic space chess guys
628 another rigged poll !
629 yeah , no indication at all that the more voters learn about her the less likely they 'll be to vote for her .
630 i usually disagree with everything obama says , but he actually has a point here .
631 if we would apply those standards to all current us americans we would have to deport the gop
632 and now trump is a lock to win california !
633 wow , almost 14 % !
634 they ca n't be still in despair , they are definitely at full blown schadenfreude
635 well most of them are not voting for hillary that 's for sure .
636 but i thought that cutting taxes guaranteed job growth !
637 for how often obama `` breaks the law ' you 'd think the gop would impeach , its not like they hold the house and senate .
638 because the free press is so accurate and unbiased .
639 good luck with that .
640 hey minorities , you 're supposed to be failing , not making america great
641 the donald hires all the best people .
642 hillary clinton will help you so long as you can afford it
643 op is an asshole .
644 inb4 censored .
645 pure coincidence .
646 but it 's hillary 's turn !
647 johnson has gotten around 16 % in some polls of latinos ; use his name !
648 says who ?
649 more like a little smoke and a lot of mirrors .
650 i love how the invisible hand of the marketplace works so well .
651 got ta reward a good idea .
652 because breitbart = credibility !
653 what a gem of a human being .
654 by laughing his ass off at trump ?
655 scumbag models receive employment while undocumented , cries about it .
656 say what you want about the tenets of any given religion , something like this is just downright insulting .
657 slayqueen
658 eli5 : why do mexicans dislike trump ?
659 so , what you 're saying is that jerry springer was a genius ?
660 the cops in pittsburgh need to wear camouflage to blend in with the foliage that covers the city .
661 i 'm gon na go ahead and side with the fascists on this one .
662 the isolationist ron paul wants to have open relations with cuba !
663 it 's just plain awful .
664 i guess they have now been replaced by atheists .
665 i support teachers unions , but this is actually a fair point .
666 was it just me , or did anyone else find the author of the article `` pretty unusual ? ''
667 is n't it racist to assume republicans are racist ?
668 i am looking forward to downvoting all the , `` well he has a point '' posts that will get made because this is reddit .
669 i do n't know what is worse , the chaos that ensured or the failed talking points they presented at the event
670 the next exhibit in the nixon library .
671 have to wonder if the same logic could n't be applied to pot use .
672 he loves it when the reach out for tomatoes .
673 is everyone overlooking that the statement is technically true .. ?
674 define `` ghetto . ''
675 the lamestream media is n't doing their job , someone has to make sure the story gets out .
676 i did n't ask for this .
677 so , how can we impeach scalia/thomas ?
678 i 'm 100 % convinced that anytime you hear `` republicans say '' followed by words , the complete opposite of what they say is the truth .
679 this is why filming needs to be made illegal .
680 tldr philanthropy : ur doing it wong .
681 i 'm gon na punch jindal in the ear .
682 because poor flower arrangement is an assault on our sense of vision ?
683 if these people are pardoned , we ca n't win the war on drugs !
684 my family was so broke my brother and i had to share our new christmas video game console like heathens !
685 more reasons not to vote for christie .
686 raid those funds !
687 proof that we finally got all them terrorists !
688 how about a 'merit system ' for republican presidential candidates .
689 so a war on war ?
690 it 's called the art of the deal .
691 the same reason liberals talk about moving to canada instead of mexico if trump is elected .
692 outlawing democrats will .
693 as we all know hillary clinton is a key member of the vast right wing conspiracy spreading malicious rumors about secretary clinton 's health .
694 did n't he say a month ago that if he lost pa it was because the election was rigged ?
695 well this is the only way to produce more republicans for the future .. they 're dying off one by one .
696 another state tries to join the race to the bottom .
697 because obama is a kenyan born muslim that is secretly working for isis and china .
698 that 's the kind of business skills we need in washington !
699 but green partiers told us the supreme court does n't matter .
700 there 's a lot of smoke but no fire
701 pfft next they 'll be asking him to apologize for freedom !
702 i mean did n't they give him a purple heart for his service ?
703 i mean , the bullet did n't help him live any longer , so ipso facto , he killed him .
704 remember though , he endorsed clinton over sanders , which obviously means he 's a corrupt far-right neoliberal ultra-conservative banister apologist .
705 it 's so great seeing a politician of rudy 's calibre sticking up for truth .
706 he 's not a medical professor because such people would n't speak ill of hillary .
707 he sure cares a lot about women 's rights for a muslim .
708 what a clear and un-opinionated piece by a medical professional that concentrated on the medical facts of the situation and not by pandering the same old shit .
709 shhh , it only counts as a bad thing when the democrats are running for election .
710 surprise surprise , it 's breibart .
711 the press is no better than clinton or trump , all of them are imbeciles - clintion- liar , trump -liar , press- self righteous clickbait vultures
712 i guess non-interventionism has some appeal to those who know war best .
713 so eloquent and convincing .
714 [ trump ] ( https : //reddit.com ) dodging the draft 5 times means his wimpy orange melon should leave the country .
715 and she will totally follow through with it , not just saying it for the bernie voters !
716 who the hell is fueling this insanity ,
717 she was probably a plant
718 you may get your wish !
719 seems to me she is done .
720 obama must have kicked him another $ 15k .
721 its pretty fucking obvious : unemployed men : things suck right now we need change hillary : i 'm going to keep everything the same but help women and minorities more .
722 it could have been $ 5.6 trillion if it were n't for that tax drain we call nasa
723 i wish i could upvote this a million times .
724 hiding behind her vagina .
725 i 'm sure he deserved it for reporting trumps campaign
726 everything out of trump 's mouth clashes with reality .
727 diplomats are just globalist shills
728 why do n't i see any mainstream reporting on this yet ?
729 it makes me feel good to look at a picture with a lot of people in it , as that is a meaningful indication of national support .
730 `` knock it off ''
731 just the kind of guy i want to represent me .
732 it 's not breitbart so obviously biased .
733 this is bigly
734 thanks obama !
735 uh huh ... sure thing mama jones , sure thing .
736 man responsible for knife attacks points out the victims are bleeding .
737 if mylan company wants to dodge this bullet , they only need to replace their democratic connected ceo with a republican connected ceo .
738 i do n't understand ... why are n't you people pulling yourself up by your bootstraps ?
739 i 'm sure he 'd find a way to blame obama for it .
740 i do n't know who paid for that , but thank you .
741 woah there , you guys do n't understand , what he actually means is that they will love him because he will make it super easy and cheap for them to switch to renewables .
742 a complete unreasonable request .
743 so counties with the largest income inequalities do n't have the best economy ?
744 they should have done this during the primary , back when there were still candidates actually worth voting for .
745 ... but other than all that , the lying , the lack of knowledge on foreign and domestic affairs , or the lack of basic understanding on what the government actually does ... why shouldnt he be president ?
746 yeah , it 's a good thing someone finally spoke up
747 well , yeah , before you gather evidence there is none .
748 this is obviously false as fox news does not have editorial standards .
749 which is par for the course in this election .
750 let 's swap the money that we give to israel with the money we give to the native americans .
751 it ai n't even october yet .
752 this is going to go over well for him when he brings up bills bj .
753 tell me again how hillary has no ideas or policies and the two candidates are exactly the same
754 we could handle it by rolling a die and get better results most of the time .
755 but what about the secret hand signals hillary was throwing out ?
756 does n't matter , fox news is now part of the liberal media conspiracy
757 who would 've thought one day germany would sell weapons to israel or israel would actually buy weapons from germany ?
758 not that stunning .
759 i do n't want any black people on my republican website !
760 i , for one , am shocked .
761 whoops~
762 it is either complete dishonesty or ignorance for fran townsend to make this argument .... laughable .
763 you act like teachers should have some say in teaching !
764 but , but .. the culture war was lost along time ago .
765 well thats just being a good christian .
766 yeah ... good fucking luck utah
767 i 'm glad to see privatization working .
768 if only everyone carried knives ... we would all be safer .
769 just another form of entitlements if you ask me .
770 worked so well for texas , why not try it across the country ?
771 * * * '' its over 9000 '' * * *
772 he 's not anti-jewish , just anti-zionist !
773 how 's that small government , minimal regulation working out for us now ?
774 the internet is just another forum for public speculation , and the public will always speculate .
775 i let out a groan when anne coulter said that .
776 time to deregulate oversight .
777 he does n't actually say that water should be privatized however .
778 98.5 % of americans dont live in louisiana .... theres nothing for us to do
779 yeah , but as long as it is n't kenya it 's perfectly okay .
780 my home state continues to embarrass me .
781 well those votes are only worth 3/5ths of a white vote .
782 right , because anyone who 's concerned about our poorly enforced border and immigration laws is obviously just racist and xenophobic .
783 stay classy lindsey .
784 is this the latest gop minority outreach program ?
785 both parties are the same
786 his loyalty is to israel first .
787 but can he keep the glasses ?
788 how dare you persecute christians by being against theocracy ?
789 well he 's out of the race ... not that he was in it .
790 they elected obama twice ...
791 welcome to 1958 .
792 they keep telling me d0nnie is smart , but that statement is just disgustingly fucking ignorant .
793 are we sure trump is n't a five-year-old ?
794 clearly he 's pandering to the felons for their vote
795 i feel all warm and fuzzy about how pretty much every american , especially republicans , are full blown email security experts .
796 oh god there goes his chances
797 fuck it , lets just make it 100 dollars an hour so we can all be rich .
798 she is essentially a republican
799 jesus fucking christ , i 'm embarrassed to live in the same state as this man .
800 hopefully the anti-vaxxers can unite and send a little cash trumps way
801 did n't they bitch when democrats called russia over the dnc leaks
802 what a crook
803 lol trump train ca n't be stopped
804 very christian of him .
805 but , but assange promised to destroy hillary .
806 well if it 's on american freedom fighters it must be true !
807 true pundit is a joke
808 but it * feels * like she 's a felon
809 and people should n't listen to random celebrities for their political opinions .
810 thanks for clarifying that standard , family values guy .
811 i wish there was some way to prove these statements .
812 oh , just what we needed !
813 how do we know that this actually happened ?
814 obama will just pardon them
815 so when is obama declaring martial law and suspending the election to secure his 3rd term ?
816 chopped and edited
817 the suit will allege that he did n't give them permission to use his comments or video at his rallies and interviews .
818 both parties are the same !
819 oh , well that makes it okay then .
820 just say `` chia head . ''
821 asked for payment up front ?
822 * leans into mic * * * wrong * *
823 he do n't need those rapists !
824 it time someone puts those freeloading toddlers to work and show them they ca n't live sucking on their mother 's tit forever !
825 seriously makes me wonder what would be left after that .
826 a lot of noted racists , homophobes , and abusers of women on that list .
827 it 's always been a achanging script .
828 bill clinton did it first !
829 everybody knows that the more a fringe right wing site resembles a limewire-approved computer virus , the more trustworthy it is !
830 i want them to show the famous republican tribal loyalty and be immolated along with their chief .
831 arnold said `` you 're fired '' long before trump ever did
832 that is probably only because they are trying to prep him for the debate .
833 mike pence is a child molester .
834 because we all know the truth that because bill is the man and he 's the one who 's really in charge .
835 that media hivemind everyone
836 and if anyone knows a sociopath when he sees one it is a wall street ceo .
837 but we already did when we elected king obama !
838 shows he 's smart .
839 [ i can not recall what this comment was before it was removed by a moderator ]
840 yes , canadians flee en masse to accrue massive amounts of debt .
841 seriously , when there were musings about the possibility of a private option , the outrage was so huge that the conservatives even came out said they would never do that .
842 because he actually committed a crime , and trump did n't .
843 go back to sleep benzo .
844 geez , who does n't feel persecuted these days ?
845 alaska really has a problem , a president trump might sell alaska back to the russians to cover his personal debts .
846 wigg ?
847 because there base has become deranged and doesnt even understand conservatism they just scream about baby killers and crooked hillary .
848 i 'm honestly just proud of them that they know there are more than 2 amendments
849 private prisons are n't that bad of an idea so long as your only throwing the people who deserve to be there in prison .
850 but his outreach to black voters was so effective .
851 in before mods delete this .
852 this is beyond fucking stupid .
853 putins going all in for trump , is n't he ?
854 the only thing dumber than giving money to donald is expecting that he 'd ever give it back to you .
855 really , i was looking forward to this interview all week
856 this is one of the most disgusting things i 've seen posted on this site .
857 that was brilliant !
858 wapo , let me ftfy : the * gate * just opened to charge chris christie with a crime on bridgegate .
859 why are people downvoting this ?
860 lol unless it 's a anti trump post people do n't believe unconfirmed sources haha .
861 why the fuck is 40 % of the nation about to vote for the most thin skinned small handed dumbass in this country ?
862 i wish he 'd stop pulling at my heart strings , i have such a soft spot for rich , famous , powerful , racist , misogynist , xenophobic `` victims ''
863 what a cuck !
864 that means she won , right ?
865 and they chose trump for that ... ?
866 well what do you expect from a republican who was deputy attorney general under bush ?
867 this breaking news just in - generalissimo francisco franco is still dead .
868 because hacking emails is now legal ?
869 he whipped out the russian thing again .
870 lol what a treat that would be .
871 so , he 's not dead , then .
872 oh no .... what a nightmare ... the horror of letting the era of cruz and mitch mcconnell controlling the senate go to bernie sanders .
873 sooooo a gang ?
874 people have been so compassionate and understanding since she came out i ca n't imagine why she did n't do it sooner !
875 booooring , typical discussion on how to campaign against sanders .
876 this will swing the election .
877 nobel laureates dismissing trump is a badge of honor for the filthy regressive right .
878 now , there 's a defense i 'm sure a judge or jury would find persuasive .
879 now even his campaign staff is rigging the election against him .
880 i mean this is exactly what the bernie bros said about the primary .
881 they 're losing the elections and it 'll only get worse .
882 fox news is one of the main voices against the idea of climate change , they ca n't have it on their own debate .
883 she 's not taking my toddlers guns , that 's for sure .
884 just more pawns in liberal scheme to steal the election .
885 i feel like calling him a nazi is losing it 's impact , better start calling him the anti-christ next .
886 i suppose it is , if you mean by getting more votes than her opponent in enough states to win the national vote among delegates/electors .
887 i 'm sure donald `` grab 'em by the pussy '' trump suing his accusers will go over well with female voters .
888 oh the poor pitiful things .
889 we will need a strong democrat house .
890 but , but romney proved that having big rallies means you win elections .
891 duh .
892 i 'd sooner vote for hillary clinton 's corpse than donald trump .
893 wow the one where he threatens sanders and say he 'll send his supporters to sanders rallies is sketchy as fuck .
894 but the gop constituency is n't at all racist .
895 they watch themselves , duh .
896 shh clerk , you 're supposed to just * imply * you 're disenfranchising american citizens from using one of their most basic rights , not say it outright .
897 nice try , ho chi minh !
898 disgusting cretins .
899 another foreigner trying to influence american elections .
900 title should read `` donald trump writes next clinton campaign ad for them , again . ''
901 but he earned that money out of his own pocket unlike crooked hilary
902 voter intimidation !
903 justice thomas , do you have anything to say about this ?
904 i trust trump will still praise the fbi should it find nothing of significance in the emails .
905 upvoted for nazi-smashing .
906 i guess there were none of trump 's `` poll watchers '' around to keep things honest .
907 ah yes , informal , unscientific opt in online polls are always the best .
908 oh no , trumps campaign is n't tinged with racism , it 's about ideas !
909 democrats sending brown shirts to rallies to instigate violence dems firebombin a republican headquarters dems attacking people just for wearing opposition shirt or having a yard sign dem candidate under fbi investigation doj met with former president and spouse of candidate on a plane in secret said doj member now pleads fifth in iran 1.7 billion to iran dems taking millions from foreign govt dem candidate gets brother on board of company that controls gold mine in haiti dem candidate deletes emails , bleach its hard drive , destroys phone with a hammer dems talk about how they bus voters in dems armed rebels and plot govt overthrows in me ... but complain that `` russians '' hacked their email to influence election yea .... republicans totally worse
910 who is anthony weiner ?
911 yeah ... i 've notice the gop rube never wants a medical `` outsider '' to perform surgery on them .
912 bu- bu- harry reid said it so it must be true !
913 i got a flat tire because a russian hacker did it .
914 let me be the first to have principles and be rational -- congrats to the church for doing the right thing in this case .
915 yeah i 'm sure that they would be happy with a violent black man .
916 propaganda and advertising have no effect ... someone really ought to let all of these companies , politicians and pundits know about this so they stop spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on something that has no effect , since just because it does n't affect one person , it does n't affect anyone else .
917 greenday came in at # 76 and at # 78 - with the same song !
918 and here i thought congress was responsible for budgets
919 yeah , no way racial profiling by a racist fuck with a gun had anything to do with it !
920 most likely the work of liberals !
921 it 's not like she was doing something innocent like laundering money for drug cartels !
922 this is what happens when you elect the same politicians over and over who cater to the lobbyists .
923 obama 2016 !
924 the title alone shows how much you do n't understand what your talking about .
925 because humans are such peaceful beings right ?
926 b-b-b-b-bbut , there 's one scientist funded by the koch brothers who disagrees , so * obviously * more study must be done since the evidence is not conclusive .
927 i 'm shocked .
928 bp and halliburton will counter sue and claim the regulations were too lax and no one inspected them for years .
929 nothing fishy about this at all .
930 well this obviously invalidates the entire prolife movement
931 ya , that mccain , such a liberal , now everyone knows !
932 vote dem 2014 .
933 the logic , i suppose , being that no one was ever gay in the boy scouts before but now that it is allowed , they suddenly are all gay .
934 the only people who are surprised by this are dumbfucks who have n't been paying attention for the last fucking 30 fucking years or that think that reaganomics actually fucking works .
935 yeah , but what about the dystopian socialist police state that would inevitably follow ?
936 noetics , modern philosophical school that declares anything you feel is right-is .
937 to be fair , it 's relatively easy to have a surplus when congress is n't approving anything to spend money on .
938 if the epa would stop protecting the water , and the usda would stop limiting the catch this pest could be eliminated in a few weeks .
939 somehow , i doubt all those people are `` terrorists . ''
940 it is up to the manatee to stand their own ground and protect their own natural rights .
941 yes , because murdering someone is a sever mental illness .
942 well , you 've got to encourage the slackers to make more money , somehow !
943 267 , possession of marijuana , that 's a shot !
944 i 'd like to see what the 4 guys she married look like , i 'm picturing hillbilly 's .
945 if you 're going to pander , you may as well pander to them what 's got it .
946 pull that ladder up faster , dude .
947 but it worked so well the last time !
948 gop begins to plot strategy to avoid gop shutdown .
949 family values candidates ride again .
950 unless the event is being held in the kitchen , she really should n't be hosting it .
951 you mean wal-mart stores were n't being used to house military weapons to attack and overthrow america with ?
952 oh good , it 's been a while since we talked about that
953 there is a big difference between 5 billion and 5 trillion .
954 world 's dumbest brain surgeon
955 but she `` cant control '' what her superpac does .
956 obama has n't been that bad .
957 and the pope does n't know what he 's talking about either .
958 bet he was from california .
959 at quinnipiac university ( connecticut ) no bias there .
960 cops are scrambling to get those easy possession busts to run up their numbers before they ca n't ride that gravy train anymore .
961 and yet , they voted people in who created the laws .
962 wow it is totally unreasonable to assume that the agency that covered up bush war crimes because `` muh republican party '' would be partisan as fuck
963 literally ones of people !
964 there will certainly be more than 1 , probably not the 5 % she needs though .
965 better build a wall around salt lake city before the good mormons get loose .
966 can imagine how many high fives he 's getting from all the other pieces of shit in texas right now ?
967 makes sense since there 's no written record about the existence of gay people prior to the rise of the soviet union .
968 when the ballot has a volcano section then we 'll talk
969 horse-race politics is the new reality tv format by which we elect our leaders .
970 looks like clinton and her staff are at it again
971 well , if they were white and would vote gop , this would n't be a problem .
972 what money ?
973 because of fair trade deals and despite their lack of natural resources , no doubt .
974 well i sure did n't see this endorsement coming .
975 this is a new low of click bait titles .
976 tomorrows nyt : fbi claims nothing suspicious found in fbi twitter activity .
977 working as intended .
978 ca n't blame them .
979 will those purged votes be added back ?
980 but my marriage means absolutely nothing if government does n't legally say so !
981 no remember that was russian hackers interfering in our election
982 what does this say about dems who ca n't win without dead and immigrant voters ?
983 other 20 % not polled .
984 thank god the clintons successfully carried out that hit
985 stop comparing everything to watergate
986 it 's getting hard to find the daily `` trump bitching about unfair media '' stories because you have to scroll through like 50 `` hillary emails '' stories .
987 i wonder if he and melania have an `` understanding '' ... surely she has to know her husband cheats .
988 you mean they do n't ?
989 that was quite a contribution to american society , too .
990 yeah , because his native american family will do so much better with trump as president .
991 i wonder who they 're voting for .
992 science schmience
993 why is it worded as though the election has already been decided ?
994 i 'm sure hillary will pardon him now instead of trying to kill him
995 you would n't have to do that often if you had a billion or two like ole ' donald .
996 therefore trump is automatically president !
997 gop : grab our privates .
998 i 'm so excited for trump to claim that the election was indeed rigged because `` they found dozens of examples of fraudulent voting , '' only to be reminded that they all supported him .
999 better luck next time .
1000 to be fair , you know it 's dangerous but a part of you wants to see stevie behind the wheel
1001 cause why not go out with some class ?
1002 hope those college students view him out .
1003 she was voting her conscience
1004 who 'd she vote for ?
1005 pretty sure she wrote in biff tannon
1006 so ... what you 're telling me is that white people are impatient ?
1007 oh , i 'm sure there be no trouble from a trump white house .
1008 yeah , we could all really come together if a party won the presidency with 12 % of the vote !
1009 glad black people have an ally in progressives
1010 yeah because clinton was n't a household name
1011 what is wrong with bringing the bathroom situation to a local level ?
1012 well once they outlaw internet porn , those speeds wo n't be as important .
1013 that was not acceptable despite your implication .
1014 when hillary actually got more votes than trump
1015 just have to laugh at comments like this .
1016 let 's face it , most high school kids are assholes .
1017 common dreams once again proves they are more fake liberal than the democratic party they attack .
1018 damn you russia !
1019 make sure you wash that brush off when you 're done with those broad strokes .
1020 i 'd wager that if put up for a referendum in california , oregon , and washington , each state would vote to stay into the union .
1021 the only hatemongering and fear and racism in this country right now is coming from the people who supported hillary clinton .
1022 maybe it 's a hoax .
1023 if she has him adopted her next child could be a democrat .
1024 well , at least he 's draining his own swamp
1025 does she have any actual experience in the pentagon ?
1026 oh , sure , * now * he starts lying .
1027 eeweeie
1028 clearly he 's just upset at the loss of manufacturing jobs in the rust belt .
1029 director of internal newsletters , tops .
1030 legacy .
1031 man , how is wikileaks not * all over * this ?
1032 so salty .
1033 not another email scandal .
1034 they 're already working on winning him the second term , apparently
1035 i 'm sure comey will get right on it .
1036 because we spent so much time at the debates and on the campaign trail discussing climate .
1037 a good thing he 's about transparency !
1038 you do realise that with 62 million votes , around 20 % of the us voted for hilary .
1039 yeah , fuck the receptionist and hr personnel .
1040 they can go to another state .
1041 and let 's not forget that other great precedent from one of donald trump 's heroes who had jews wear stars of david on their clothing .
1042 well that solves it megyn kelly is clearly a liberal shill !
1043 apparently it pays pretty well to be a protester .
1044 yay !
1045 i can see why the religious right really like him .
1046 warren should have endorsed bernie sanders
1047 this guy could 've been president lol you snooze you lose we america now beetches
1048 fuck you why dont you move to another country asshole
1049 good people do n't smoke they drink scotch and beat their wives .
1050 does n't matter , it is trump 's fault
1051 the majority of american voters picked hillary to be president .
1052 they are just creating new jobs !
1053 has a single woman 's name besides nikki haley even been put out as being considered for any cabinet position ?
1054 it sure worked out well , did n't it ?
1055 no conflict of interest here
1056 hear , hear
1057 cut out the middle man
1058 oh yes , let 's look to the slave owning , genocidal , classist , and wealthy founding fathers to save us from trump .
1059 it 's ok because trump will get rid of political correctness and `` urban '' people will be put in their place .
1060 why not make tax optional too ?
1061 survey , you mean some useless poll .
1062 crooked donald
1063 this will end well
1064 it 's almost as if multiple people are posting their own thoughts !
1065 but but ... i was told this could n't happen all along
1066 authoritarian proposes authoritarian policy , news at 11 .
1067 do n't we already have that ?
1068 let me guess she 's a racist too ?
1069 this changes everything
1070 he was n't vetted and it worked out just fine ...
1071 i am going to express my outrage over this by commenting here .
1072 it would take longer than 4 years to sell all his shit
1073 i won ms america if you ignore the contest , the voting , and me being a guy .
1074 i for one believe trump and want to recount every single vote so that he can take credit for the popular vote and be vindicated in his claim .
1075 watch out donnie , the hillary dream team is coming to get you !
1076 this woman is now qualified for - sec of commerce ( she is a good negotiator ) - sec of state ( she is tough and yep loyalist ) - health ministry ( because she can lead by example ) - consultant at breitbart ( because they are not misogynistic )
1077 * that we know of
1078 trump : `` the election is rigged '' liberals : `` lol le drumpf is so stupid '' * trump wins * liberals : `` omg the election was rigged ''
1079 because we young ppl woke
1080 i thought obama and hillary created it ?
1081 i guess the swamp needed it 's yoda back .
1082 yeah let california and new york decide every presidency .
1083 2.3 million illegal votes !
1084 no
1085 nice selective inclusion of dates to exaggerate your point , which is n't really a point , it 's just juvenile politics as usual .
1086 all of the nice , loving , progressive people want him dead because he is such a hater .
1087 voted up .
1088 i see the paul voting brigade is out in force today
1089 time to trim the fat with the leeches claiming eitc too .
1090 i 'm shocked i tell you !
1091 for people who hate abortions , they seem to want to cause more with stupidity such as this .
1092 stay classy , san diego .
1093 all of you are conspiratards
1094 it is true , they are using data mining to detect patterns in call history .
1095 as we all know , guns only = murdering children in schools .
1096 it 's almost like the war on terror is just an excuse to remove our freedoms .
1097 because , as we all know , english is the official language of the usa .
1098 i 'm sure he knows what is best .
1099 lots of lip service to outreach , followed by doubling down on aggressive social legislation that offends women , latinos , gays , and lower incomes .
1100 and no matter what we say , republicans in the house wo n't let the house vote on the presidents job proposals .
1101 remember : there is no difference between the democrats and the republicans .
1102 you have to believe him ... he wears glasses now .
1103 kids today have it too easy though
1104 is this for medical or just general legalization ?
1105 do i smell a new scandal ?
1106 nah , we just have to fund more tax-cuts for the corporations and trickling will save the economy
1107 now vermont will turn into an immoral pit of chaos , just you wait .
1108 letterman is a loser !
1109 some people in this country can not responsibly exercise the right to bear arms .
1110 well , people on reddit say he does n't have a chance so i do n't see why he does n't just give up .
1111 maybe congress should form a committee to look into this
1112 geez , i would have thought barry would have been long ago impeached .
1113 from the people who resorted to their own polling when they did n't like what they were seeing last go round ... yeah , sure , right .
1114 unless we go by twitter supporters , in which case trump won .
1115 bourgeois idealism
1116 lol , that 's fine because bernie 's going to be president .
1117 fact checking is liberal conspiracy !
1118 nice lead-ins to a very substantive questions , roskam .
1119 he 's probably advocating a voucher system so everyone gets the money to go to whatever school they want .
1120 sounds about right
1121 damn people are responding to this , huh
1122 waiting for right wing to radio decry the `` mexican liberal media '' ?
1123 perhaps ... it 's a good thing that we have now stopped aging in it 's tracks .
1124 rubio is a redneck
1125 capital one - who 's in your wallet ?
1126 so he 's a conservative ... no he does n't bible thump enough .
1127 naw you think ?
1128 he 's getting his tips from putin - the pro at this thing for the last decade+ .
1129 obvious liberal media .
1130 tl ; dr : liberals unfairly reject poor reasoning and lies .
1131 ... will be too busy toppling the us !
1132 but it 's not racism , it 's just `` economic anxiety '' !
1133 i 'm sure trump has called obama worse
1134 now if the ny times is praising obama it must be true , i guess .
1135 the pickles were pre-opened , i repeat : those pickles were staged .
1136 well , we ca n't have cats talking shit to the president , can we ?
1137 but , but , they should 've objected sooner and gone to the meetings , now it 's too late !
1138 blond trust .... he said blond trust , 'member ?
1139 that 's on the us taxpayer tab so no big deal .
1140 the truth and reality are liberal propaganda !
1141 if he 's incompetent he 's already on trump 's list for sure .
1142 sure .
1143 you know it 's bad when right-wing owned weather channel is coming out in support of climate change .
1144 what happened to all the good brain people
1145 every state that rolled blue is welcome in canada .
1146 hope he gets shot in the fuckin head .
1147 lazy bums !
1148 kellyanne conway is a victim of liberal intolerance
1149 he told me he was self funding his campaign like 73 times though , what the heck ?
1150 they probably think some crazy shits about to go down .
1151 for everyone who voted for republicans - do n't worry - i 'm sure they will find a way to give you special treatment so you wo n't lose a penny of that money you already paid into ss
1152 i 've been saying this for weeks .
1153 i found the silent majority
1154 yes , clearly the * most * important thing !
1155 my thoughts exactly !
1156 disband the cia its filled with libcucks
1157 i 'm personally excited never to have clean air or water again .
1158 wrong , they were all illegal votes !
1159 internal screaming
1160 trump is a living parody of himself , he 's what a stupid person thinks a smart person sounds like .
1161 sure its high , but how high would it be if we did n't ' count illegals and california ?
1162 it just makes sense that my vote is worth less than the vote of someone in a different state , right ?
1163 it is almost like something that is completely necessary to decide about the ethics of a candidate .
1164 maybe those people should start working , earning , and paying for the nice things they want in life ( it works for me ) , instead of asking the `` evil rich people '' to change their diapers for them .
1165 in fucking * denver * no less .
1166 but he 's under audit !
1167 pence is fine smoking pole tho
1168 maybe gravity should dispute him and just * let him go *
1169 what an asshole .
1170 it 's really too bad that religious suicide cults are n't a lot more popular these days .
1171 god put it there to question your faith
1172 this thread proves the validity of the idea behind the electoral college , that 's for sure .
1173 kingdom and a princess for something that has n't been hacked by russia !
1174 ( leans into mic with pursed lips ) `` wrong . ''
1175 history has proved harassment and threats work .
1176 the `` affordable '' care act is a fucking joke
1177 vanity fair in s owned by conde nast , same company that owns reddit
1178 it takes a long time to get the death camps ready to take all the guns and kill the christians and straight people with their own guns
1179 this is depressing
1180 he 's just playing a game of 5-d chess with these media types !
1181 sad
1182 you know what to do , conservatives ... get the * fuck off facebook *
1183 this should be investigated by the fbi and suspect should be charged with treason
1184 i 'm all for liberalism , but where 's the political discourse here ?
1185 is n't it interesting that is exactly the proportion of the poplar vote he won by ?
1186 can confirm katy perry will be our next ambassador to russia .
1187 they 're not actually paying said candidate for that lil gem of wisdom i trust ?
1188 in our nation that enshrined freedom of religion , only merry christmas will do , goddamn it !
1189 and we were doing so great before that !
1190 he needs to be fired or prosecuted .
1191 yeah i 'm sure that putin was n't chuckling in the background or anything
1192 oh , thanks for setting us straight , federalist .
1193 ruh roh .
1194 race to the third-world !
1195 why , it 's almost as if his goal is the exact opposite of reconciliation !
1196 i wonder if anyone 's products will be exempt from the tariff
1197 he 's just so smart that he 's feigning ignorance and bloodthirst so that mad can be leveraged for finally stamping out nuclear proliferation
1198 you better not be one of those pussy european socialist whites though
1199 2.1 % more votes than trump -- exclude the illegal votes and he 'd be waaaaaay ahead .
1200 fdr hid that he used a wheelchair .
1201 his bank accounts say he is poorer than he claims as well .
1202 that 's kind of a fucked up thing to do
1203 should have just droned him .
1204 and it 's only because he is in his 90 's and does n't know who trump is .
1205 because she was innocent
1206 * anti-free speech center ftfy
1207 wow this matters .
1208 shame to see obama engaging in petty point scoring decision making , the man lacks any class and composure
1209 that makes him smart
1210 take that america !
1211 hey now , shutting down government and coming up with new excuses to investigate hillary is hard work , they need a well deserved break .
1212 they need the bads to collect rain water
1213 so basically majority of these people are bitches and assholes ... yeah that fit america perfectly
1214 become elite ( but be humble ) let that be your mantra .
1215 of course , they would * never * abuse this ....
1216 : - ) [ poster name noted ]
1217 do n't you idiots know that pretending something does n't exist means it will go away ?
1218 another post where idiots will comment based on a misleading title .
1219 was this guy speaking english ?
1220 next , they 'll be joining oj to find the real killers .
1221 but there 's no war on women , or a woman 's right to choose .
1222 there 's no chance in hell of that passing .
1223 and so fails the republic of texas .
1224 are they monitoring the nations plumbing as well ?
1225 i doubt hoopz agrees with this .
1226 albeit the cabinet has become whiter , maler : ) , and more from ivy league .
1227 so ... three presidents ... what an amazing statistic
1228 yes , thank goodness , daddy dick cheney came by and gave them their directions .
1229 this title is not loaded at all .
1230 submit to my authority citizen !
1231 lol that fucking title .
1232 when will the left wing media say it does n't matter like they always have with the clintons ?
1233 somalian pirates we
1234 i 'll start getting coffee there just because of this and i * hate * starbucks .
1235 already getting rid of jobs is n't he
1236 why ca n't they simply sell off some of their stocks ?
1237 the rich should n't pay any taxes because they are demigods that make the crops grow- sorry , let me update for this era , stocks grow and without them we would all die .
1238 they may seem contained because most of them migrated to europe .
1239 its interesting that it kind of points out that hillary running for senate may have been part of the reason he lost to bush
1240 happy to know he is having so much `` fun . ''
1241 i ca n't imagine why .
1242 ca n't wait
1243 ruh roh .... turns out he has benefited from super pac money .
1244 this is the basic definition of a straw man fallacy .
1245 let 's see if the media calls this a `` clash '' or a `` fracas '' like they did when trump supporters beat a protester at one of his rallies .
1246 i also move that criminals should be referred to as `` people who committed a crime , '' or at the least `` amazing people who 've fallen on hard times , but everyone 's a special flower , unless they 're white ''
1247 because transgendered leftests are the natural enemy of planned parenthood
1248 the constitution itself states it extremely clearly , i do n't think the religious right cares .
1249 shooting tracker is the only open source of this type of information .
1250 do we take him literally , symbolically or literally ?
1251 no democratic campaign organizer could have ever foreseen that campaigning in deep red states and pandering to republicans while dismissing your own party 's base would have not been a successful strategy .
1252 yes , the group that was least likely to support trump , are somehow the reason that trump got elected
1253 loveeee these websites that tell me what i think
1254 that 's all i needed to know .
1255 just exercising their religious tolerance .
1256 i 'm certain that would make our nation safer .
1257 it certainly would be nice to see the people seize back some power from the unelected and unaccountable bureaucracy .
1258 they should make obama tell us .
1259 not to worry they will all be able to find assembly line jobs in the modern high tech automated factories that trump is going to force back into the us .
1260 oh it must be true because he said it will happen !
1261 the intelligence community is made up of liberal shills
1262 elitist eggheads , what do they know
1263 no no guys you 're all wrong they 're just liberal elites .
1264 careful , with talk like that people are gon na vote trump again !
1265 yes , lord knows this up and coming actress needs the coverage .
1266 there 's 1 job he created ... but it 's for alec baldwin .
1267 poor thing , you would think he would look into trump 's conflicts of interest , you know , something current that would have an impact on the nation now .
1268 `` new survey says ... '' - fox news
1269 well , at least we wo n't have to worry about any ethics violations , right gop ?
1270 only the opinions of `` real '' americans count .
1271 another poll says fox viewers want to go back to the aca instead of obamacare
1272 tomi lahren is a dumb person 's idea of a smart person
1273 because drug addicts are criminals not victims
1274 you ai n't seen nothin yet .
1275 unexpected .
1276 i will believe it when fox news tells me to .
1277 who knew voting for duckworth would pay off so quickly .
1278 is this draining the swamp ?
1279 # fakenews
1280 you got ta spend money to make money , peasants .
1281 look another unnamed source .. just about as credible as cnn
1282 if we 're going to be serious about race , then we need to acknowledge when hate crimes are committed against whites people as well .
1283 this seems coup-coup , i meant cuckoo .
1284 liberals hate black people who dare to step off the democrat plantation .
1285 do you know what treason actually is ?
1286 pence is a failure , period .
1287 trumps president we are all going to die .. hilarious
1288 trump knows more than the generals .
1289 i 'm sure this will convince the deniers .
1290 he obviously forgot about the part of the constitution that makes the president a king and can demand his presence at court or off with his head .
1291 32 million little people !
1292 unfortunately lepage seems oblivious to the various ideological realignments the parties have gone through over the years ...
1293 well if russia says so then it must be true .
1294 my high school mascot was a grizzly bear so she may be on to something .
1295 but what about the death panels ?
1296 well it will be at least 2-3 million people more than showed up at obama 's if you 'd just stop counting all the illegals ...
1297 lincoln is definitely best remembered for suspending habeas corpus , everything else he did was inconsequential because if this .
1298 barack , we miss you already .
1299 he does n't like to tweet either but does it obsessively .
1300 goldman ceo knows he can tell trump to go fuck himself and still get a dick suck from donnie anytime he wants .
1301 salt
1302 woot , more ideological purity tests from the far left because both parties are the same
1303 it 's about time .
1304 but remember , everything that does n't support trump is fake .
1305 seriously , just cause your fucking donald trump does n't mean you 're first lady .
1306 she 's the modern day edith from al in the family .
1307 most likely just changing things over let 's not all go rioting after 2 hours in the presidency
1308 but r_the_swamp has been assuring us he would be the most lgbt friendly president ever !
1309 worked for nixon .
1310 hey he is just presenting the `` alternative facts ''
1311 maybe if people just keep him busy arguing about stupid shit like this , he wo n't have time to do , you know , presidential stuff .
1312 spot on analysis
1313 obviously a * liberal * perspective camera .
1314 how long before congress jams some midnight libel legislation up our asses ?
1315 i only clicked this , to change the color of the post .
1316 * millions of humans
1317 scarlet johannson , 2/10 , would not bang .
1318 i 'm a little suspicious that mexico did n't extradite el chapo they sent him here on an assignment
1319 too bad the police wo n't do their job and do the same here .
1320 butheremails
1321 an excuse to get autographs .
1322 while i totally agree with this , where was the outrage when clinton did it ?
1323 well , if he wanted to fully alienate anyone left in the federal government , this 'll be it .
1324 oh ya know , just a few bad apples .
1325 250,000 die each year due to medical errors so maybe a lack of care will save a few .
1326 holy fascism batman !
1327 man .. trump 's supporters are going to be pissed when they find out that we are still supporting countries that are financially supporting isis .. ah wait .. it 's still obama 's fault .
1328 but i had to send a message by voting for jill stein !
1329 becoming ?
1330 business as usual .
1331 enjoy your sparkling lead-water , america .
1332 so a portrait of president obama 's inauguration crowd then ?
1333 remember ... no matter who it is hillary would have picked the same one because both parties are the same
1334 well it 's a good thing people do n't live in the environment , or else this would be cause for concern .
1335 moreso , why did the dems pack them into the state with the worst citizen-to-electoral vote ratio
1336 * for democrats .
1337 well then trump wo n't have look too far now .
1338 finally , the national nightmare is over .
1339 i always thought having terrific relations with someone you share a very long border with was a terrible idea .
1340 it 's the * conservative * thing to do
1341 at least 300,000 of those were sent by illegals
1342 yeah , there are way more republicans right now .
1343 `` petition '' lol
1344 bbbbbbbbaby you aint seen nothin yet !
1345 was n't the cia ignored by bush too ?
1346 the ones with `` fox news '' in the corner ?
1347 yuge .
1348 where can i sign ?
1349 you mean 6 years was n't enough time to come up with a coherent plan ?
1350 is this something that would be contested in the judicial branch ?
1351 i hate trump but this is dumb .
1352 so , he is dealing with our major enemies first .
1353 who dat
1354 they 're just nobel laureates , they do n't compare to the integrity of a failed businessman who works with literal nazis
1355 so now we can impeach him right ?
1356 but democracy has the same root as democrat therefore it 's bad !
1357 i have red hair and freckles .. should i worry about being deported ?
1358 gee , the wall has n't even started construction and it 's working .
1359 wowwie george soros really outdid himself this time
1360 in the coming years we 're going to learn a lot about how law-enforcement officers self-select for fascistic tendencies .
1361 neo-nazi whitewash .
1362 i doubt that every single trump voter was against clinton 's server .
1363 those evil green card holders ....
1364 some people are n't going to like this , but this is absolutely the coalition we need to build .
1365 barron is a real person though , apparently .
1366 glory to arstotzka !
1367 oh , i 'm sure these memos were just a new 'prank ' cooked up by 4chan
1368 just reading the title broke my heart
1369 but how does that help anyone but putin ?
1370 yeah you mean george soros , who was connected to over 50 groups financially at the womens ( who did n't vote for trump ) march ?
1371 this never would have never happened under an obama administration .
1372 yeah , but that was a liberal black president .
1373 still too low .
1374 and the washington examiner is totally trusted by anyone who is anyone .
1375 you can ask that question at almost every point in history and the answer is always the same ... people are ignorant
1376 but obama 's wrong , america does n't need his socialist tax-breaks for small businesses , american needs our capitalist tax-breaks for small businesses , do n't you unserstand the difference ?
1377 it 's cause obama is an undercover muslim too ... he knows where to find em .
1378 how does this help americans ?
1379 we would n't get because we poor .
1380 heavy handed ... the us ... * never * ...
1381 god bless america land that i love stand beside her and guide her ...
1382 just remember , the more you suffer on earth , the more you 'll be rewarded in heaven .
1383 on a related note , republicans are reaching out to black voters by asking if they can touch their hair .
1384 i 'm so happy to see someone standing strong for their principles !
1385 i guessing that now the president ca n't control gas prices after all .
1386 do n't worry , electronic voting machines will fix all of this !
1387 but if even one life is saved
1388 yes mike , because something bad happened that man did n't do that completely negates and absolves responsibility for the bad that man did do .. perfect logic scumbag .
1389 following that obtuse logic , there should be no dui laws because a few teens ignore them anyway .
1390 same difference .
1391 matt damon would play an excellent snowden .
1392 maybe the citizens of beaver county , utah will wise up and throw out the da who decided to actually enforce these insane laws .
1393 yeah , in stark contrast to the overall electorate which always makes great well thought out voting decisions based on careful consideration of complicated arguments and policies , and in no way favors oversimplifications and voting how they `` feel '' at the time .
1394 did he say anything about bringing the deficit down to a six year low ?
1395 do n't downvote this because he is stupid , upvote it so people * see * that he is stupid !
1396 this is what you get when you have the amateurs in congress running things ...
1397 is he really intending to adapt the phrase `` czar '' or is this a title being imposed by the press ?
1398 one down .
1399 i guess it is time to start up that jadehelm thing again , only this time they really will be taking over texas
1400 we should wait on the ban until some muslims kill 140+ americans like they did in france .
1401 democracy is not pacifism .
1402 yes , the same way alec baldwin moved to europe when george w was reelected .
1403 but agraba has a genie of mass destruction !
1404 why does n't he just give up ?
1405 i knew it was a lie as soon as she said it , only hillary could outright lie and everyone know it , and yet the station says she `` won '' by a landslide .
1406 this study done by the federal reserve bank of san francisco , concludes that raising the minimum wage to $ 15 would reduce the number of jobs by 100,000-200,000 .
1407 tells you a lot about conservatives does n't it .
1408 dnc establishments and dws is doing a much better job controlling the party and setting up the right stage for hillary shame on you , rnc , shame on you
1409 what wo n't obama do to distract us from benghazi ?
1410 hope he puts all those commissions to good use .
1411 voter registration records are public information , released by every state , including your address , etc , as well as which elections you vote in .

1415 wait really ?
1416 true courage is apple removing the headphone jack from the iphone 7 .
1417 are speakers meant to be this partisan ?
1418 i 'm so glad that trump is going to create so much more transparency
1419 enjoy that tasty lead-filled water , america !
1420 no hypocrisy here .
1421 why did n't he include `` having both arms broken , at the same time ? ''
1422 do n't be mean to megalania or she will never move into the white house !
1423 of course not silly , that would be persecution
1424 seriously - the guy is nothing more than an attention whore ... just ignore him and his bullshit and he 'll fade away soon enough .
1425 that 's going to end well .
1426 this is what the alt-right , in there false bravado , are scared of , a four month old girl that needs surgery .

1430 since a hawaii republican threatening to leave got upvoted , here 's a wv dem actually leaving the democratic party
1431 looks like coors will get an uptick in sales
1432 long live the queen
1433 as usual , `` but hilary did '' is her excuse .
1434 thats some mighty fine swamp draining .
1435 we 're fucked
1436 the free market will surely voluntarily protect our clean air and water once freed from oversight .
1437 so everyone 's `` calling for '' probes & amp ; investigations ; when is one going to actually happen ?
1438 ah , come on guys - just cuz he 's coo-coo for cocoa cocoa puffs does n't mean he 's batshit crazy !
1439 send her back
1440 wow the hard evidence on this is astounding
1441 that is bad when fake news ca n't bother to be enlightened by alt facts .
1442 it 's going to be a long 8 years .
1443 who cares ?
1444 literally trying to go backwards in time
1445 i 'm pretty sure we 're all quaking in our boots now .
1446 i think they are really starting to lose the plot , all the `` fake news '' needs to do is keep pointing out their craziness until they go completely nuts and implode .
1447 ca n't wait for schools to be turned into gods temple
1448 i 'm glad i live in kentucky i 'm not on obamacare or the aca i 'm on kynect .
1449 evidence : all his billionaire cabinet nominees keep getting approved by the republican controlled senate .
1450 do the two words `` berkeley riot '' mean anything to you ?
1451 but muh librul tears
1452 well even their best black player is named white !
1453 remember folks , all negative polls are fake according to the white house
1454 i 'm very shocked that the approval ratings of a racist homophobic xenophobic antisemitic misogynistic bigot are plummeting .
1455 has n't even been a month yet ?
1456 the `` blue collar millionaire '' !
1457 boycott ivanka !
1458 yeah but how many illegals voted in the circuit court opinion ?
1459 his reply `` 45 '' was not nearly as much fun for anyone .
1460 ca n't wait for the `` 9th circuit court blew a 3-0 lead '' memes after scotus overturns
1461 humanity must resist the whole reactionary and brutal capitalist order , no hesitation to it .
1462 i heard it was billions .
1463 `` i love the poorly educated . ''
1464 and a sense of ethics .
1465 i 'm shocked they have n't tapped jim cramer yet .
1466 let 's never talk to him or his son ever again .
1467 it 's getting a lot harder to not tell a lot of people around me that like that orange buffoon to eat a bag of dicks .
1468 another totally legit site .
1469 i suggest going on twitter and calling the intelligence community nazis again , that will help smooth things out
1470 it 's not racist at all you pea-brains .
1471 you 're right , that 's why when trump tells me that his buddy jaime dimon , the ceo of jp morgan , gives him advice on which regulations to take away , i do n't listen .
1472 right ... because trump will be less of an embarrassment later on : d
1473 completely different election processes for one
1474 fake news
1475 was n't michelle obama trying to sell fitness and nutrition ?
1476 that 's a bingo !
1477 i 'm going to need alex jones to cry over it before i sympathize .
1478 dude , chill out , it 's valentine 's day .
1479 flynn was a democrat
1480 cnn is fakenews
1481 in regards to kellyanne conway 's recent `` controversy '' never forget that michelle obama endorsed and did commercials for subway in the white house .
1482 because investigations are meant to hurt the other party 's electoral prospects , not to uncover the truth
1483 republicans have dropped all efforts to disguise their corruption , they know their supporters do n't care about ethics .
1484 truly this man is god 's own gift to speech makers everywhere .
1485 she recanted all of this folks and said she only went on there to get a free trip .
1486 but he put ben carson as secretary of hud so he 's not , or ever has been , a racist
1487 he also desegregated the military .
1488 `` this is why trump won . ''
1489 obviously he meant presidents who were celebrities before they became president who are also white male republicans .
1490 i was about to say ... what about putin .
1491 i mean they only live in the inner cities so possibly ?
1492 look into kerouac discussing the american haiku .
1493 good on april ryan for making this happen .
1494 i ca n't wait for this to tank the economy
1495 yeah but remember , trump knows more than the generals .
1496 virtually learning is almost as good as real learning !
1497 yea but you 're forgetting the fact that trump is not taking a salary so there ... fake news
1498 donald wo n't believe it until the national enquirer picks up the story .
1499 great news a trump hotel is coming to dubai , it was granted special status other great news , the navy will now be protecting all dubai 's merchant ships totally unrelated
1500 attacking the first amendment does n't make america great .
1501 what is this , a petition for ants ?
1502 they 've had 6 years to work on a replacement , but need just 2 more weeks to make it perfect ?
1503 besides violation of the law .
1504 ohio republican * voter *
1505 an orange claimed it was wmd
1506 and he just threw fox under the bus .
1507 i ca n't wait until this gets hacked , and then i can just tell `` emails '' everytime i talk politics until 2020 .
1508 well , `` consent * is * oppressive ... ''
1509 well , at least victims can feel safe going right to the police to report these incidents
1510 that 's why you never go full breitbart .
1511 no worries , i 'm sure there is nothing going on in the world .
1512 surprise surprise
1513 i mean yeah , once someone does it then it should just be ok .
1514 neck to goiter
1515 really proving they are the pro life party here ......
1516 those damn liberals , is there no depth to which they will not stoop ?
1517 what are you talking about , only minorities have drug problems
1518 this 'theory ' ... sounds like this dude needs to put down the bong .
1519 i ca n't wait to hear about this wasteful spending from the fiscal conservative party !
1520 yea fuck those guys amirite .
1521 thank god we saved free speech by taking down those pesky sjws and their pc culture !
1522 daily caller is a poor man 's breitbart .. so what does that tell you of it 's quality .
1523 good thing trump cant be bribed .. his admin might be full of donors with special interests instead of experts .
1524 where are the the_dumbass supporters that were adamant that their candidate was pro-marijuana ?
1525 yes , it 's better to make pot illegal and send that money over the border to the cartels .
1526 these people think it 's time to party .... i guess they ca n't read .
1527 another colossal waste of resources .
1528 i regret that i have but one downvote to give to neocon revisionism online .
1529 at least he started wearing a big-boy tie
1530 ca n't stop winning
1531 dhs may have strapped its balls on .
1532 all i want to know .... with all this cutting .... have my taxes gone down yet ?
1533 reince priebus ... lie ?
1534 probably just leftover hate from the obama administration
1535 now activists just need trump supporters to support replacing obamacare with the aca .
1536 good .
1537 how do you justify to your foreign friends the american people electing trump ?
1538 were these the same polls that predicted hillary winning by five billion votes ?
1539 no less an endorsement or political statement by visiting dignitaries obliged to stay at any one of his hotels .
1540 as told by the lying sack of shit reince priebus .
1541 someone really gullible and accountable to no one , preferably .
1542 oh for the love of god ... ok yeah screw the children !
