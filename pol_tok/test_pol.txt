703 0 the centipede brigade is busy today .
704 1 trump is going to release his tax returns at the same time he releases the stuff he found out about obama in hawaii .
705 1 so they have to poll at 15 % in 5 different polls , when most polls do n't even bother having a 3rd party option , yeah not rigged at all
706 0 it 's pretty sad when a two term governor is n't automatically included in the polls .
707 1 that 's sexist
708 0 probably not but they should be drafted .
709 0 bullets are cheaper anyway
710 1 how ethical of pfizer !

712 0 decent conclusions based on behavior .
713 1 then why are all the californians moving to austin ?

715 0 kansas is probably the best and most obvious example of how trickle-down economics destroy the country .
716 1 i 'm sure if he just keeps digging deeper he 'll get out of that hole .
717 1 because kentucky is such a crucial battleground state
718 0 unleash something unpredictable happens , she 's going to beat trump , but probably not by a lot .
719 1 because saying that you will do something does n't mean you should then do it .
720 0 call this chick floyd mayweather , cuz shes good at duckin .
721 0 we 've been giving the supply side of the economy breaks on breaks on breaks for decades , but anything giving a break to the demand side of the economy is `` an absolute disaster for our economy . ''

745 0 i 'm sure she will get right on that .
746 1 wow , this is a new thought !

761 0 is n't `` jew-hating anti-semite '' redundant ?
762 1 wow , i did n't see that coming
763 1 americans could have saved the money to buy bullets to kill more muslim in middle-east
764 0 this means police are earning more overtime $ $ $ $ - not a bad thing for the economy : )
765 1 foxnews did not say so , so it is not true

767 0 this guy 's getting desperate .
768 1 perry is desperately trying to take queues from trump 's playbook , since that worked out so well for him and all .
769 1 so why are n't they buying robots from china then ?
770 0 now they can pay american workers an appropriate wage for the work .
771 0 and after that , we can just make knives really expensive .
772 1 that homicidal and suicidal killing spree that i was planning may have to be cancelled because the bullets would cost 100 $ instead of 20 $ : ( brilliant idea !
773 0 how come those who refer to others as 'gun nuts ' are often the most fanatical bunch ?
774 1 great now all the gangs will be shooting people .

783 0 someday rich white people will overcome this bigotry .
784 1 next thing you know they will start getting uppity .
785 1 it 's definitely not mental health of individuals .
786 0 jack thompson is that you ?
787 1 but there 's a `` war on christmas '' out there started by them dang godless liberal commies !
788 0 republicans : opposing problems that do n't exist since ww2 .
789 0 because smart people with funds will be able to convince others of something especially when they have time and no opposition .
790 1 must have been that powerful mythical liberal msm .
791 1 at the risk of sounding crass ... in curious to see how quickly the gop restores the cuts since they ended up hurting a corporations profits .
792 0 pay your employees a living wage , assholes
793 1 think of how much money could have been saved if they had only made a run to mcdonalds for state dinners with visiting heads of state .

798 0 how much did they make from stealing oil and resources .. plenty more then their deficit i 'm sure
799 0 and minnesota just keeps gaining
800 1 yeah , because the govenor of a state is directly responsbile for the coming and going of every single job in that state .
801 0 she 's still a thing ?
802 1 yeah , because everyone can see how you voted ...
803 0 i 'm still blown away that the party of `` personal freedoms '' and `` lack of government intervention '' are the people who think government should make people criminals for using something put here by their white judeo-christian god .
804 1 yeah cause democrats have been so on board with ending the drug war
805 1 good thing that war in iraq magically paid for itself with oil or something .
806 0 the worst part of this policy is that i get the feeling they do n't even care how these wars turn out ; the important part is the mountains of cash spent on them .
807 1 lets hope he can some day reach the level of respect as the previous administration
808 0 would n't it make more sense for gallup to ask non-americans if obama is respected on the world stage ?
809 0 i am going out on a limb and guessing that this is what happens when the federal government has a shit ton of military equipment that is no longer in use overseas and the local police needs cheap vehicles for events that require something more than a normal squad car .
810 1 it 's ok , it keeps a lot of american working .
811 1 especially a plant god created

815 1 you do n't support going to war , you do n't support the troops .
816 0 if the ayatollahs and their bretheren , the republicans hate it , then it must be good .
817 0 if you want to see your incomes stop falling you should call your representative and oppose the expansion of h1-b visas which are driving down wages .
818 1 well , yeah , but the rich are using that extra money to create high-paying jobs .

825 1 not while there are people with crohn 's disease using pot as medicine to imprison !
826 0 marijuana is n't a cure-all , but i 'll be damned if it does n't make serious sales tax income .
827 0 on one hand , it 's very pathetic and quite horrifying that the majority of children born to women under 30 are in single parent households , on the other , this is a very wrong-headed attempt to try to deal with that issue .
828 1 that 's `` smaller , less-intrusive government '' for you .
829 1 also said that he reads playboy for the articles and they do n't pollute to increase bottom-line , putting all that pollution out in the world is its own reward .

839 0 hopefully this will prove to be true , once he has melania on the first-lady track .
840 1 the press is not dishonest at all
841 1 obviously , because it 's just trump pointing out how easily our politicians are for sale .
842 0 because bribery is legalized in the us , as lobbying and political donations
843 0 katy perry is not gay .
844 1 yep , violently attack trump supports , i 'm sure that 's exactly what you should do to a candidate 's supporters you do n't like .

856 0 it protects us from mob rule , and i 'm glad it does .
857 1 clearly because she 's innocent .
858 0 sexism
859 1 but if i type in `` gary johnson beats trump and clinton '' into google , i 've got dozens of polls saying otherwise !
860 0 panic now that polls showjohnson is pulling from clinton more than trump : here comes the media discredit !
861 1 well , the media sure pushed that story .. what a surprise !
862 0 she was trying to force his hand and he called her bluff .
863 1 but those tax breaks for corporations will trickle down

865 0 what does judge joe brown have to say ?
866 1 well if conservative mouthpiece and fauxnews former judge napolitano ( who has zero inside informations ) says it then it must be true .
867 1 but she said there would be no more shoes to drop from the fbi .
868 0 this seems like a really polite way of saying `` we backed up her whole server . ''
869 0 this attitude is a good reason for kicking the most hardcore supporters of bernie out of the democratic party .
870 1 based upon this statement that you will not support hillary , you clearly are a sexist pig supporting the oppression of the patriarchy .
871 0 no one cares , vote for who you want to vote for .
872 1 sexist !
873 1 because the gop is n't known for bigotry and discrimination .
874 0 i ca n't believe bernie supporters made violence the cornerstone of theirs .

885 0 if trump had said this every station would be talking about it lmao
886 1 better than how trump was congratulating himself after the shooting , right ?
887 0 wait ... who is buying guns with no questions asked ?
888 1 `` nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law '' just being watched by the fbi is due process right ?
889 1 50 people shooting in a dark , packed club while drinking would have made this a much better situation .
890 0 with music so loud you cant even tell if its gunfire till you see others running , by then probably a dozen were dead in a few secods
891 0 blaming shit on video games , music , movies , or tv shows is the height of stupidity .

925 1 no one saw that coming
926 0 listen to paul krugman .
927 1 he was lied to .
928 0 dithering senile bigot , and that 's his legacy forever
929 0 yes it would be a big deal - get your head out of the left right paradigm and start asking yourself if as an american it 's wrong or right .
930 1 it would have been worse because he 's not president obama .
931 0 i noticed that the comments were closed at that website .
