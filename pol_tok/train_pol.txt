1303 1 thanks obama !
1304 0 sad .
1305 0 in a continuing abdication of all adult responsibility , republicans will just blame obama

1307 1 still more than obama created !
1308 0 if we stop protecting the current ones from black lung , can we count the jobs created twice when they die ?

1719 1 a young brother 's got it bad cus he 's brown ?
1720 0 because black lives matter is a group of fucking idiots that use any excuse to push their own agenda .
1721 0 far from a trump supporter but bernie should get grilled about this it was mostly bernie bros out there
1722 1 it was hillarys fault i bet .
1723 0 he 's within his rights to do so just as much as protestors are within their rights to ~~throw him out~~ make him unilaterally decide to cancel his own events .
1724 1 no , if he does it he 's a nazi
1725 1 right and the game against hillary has been squeaky clean too
1726 0 this is super ironic coming from the crew that thinks clinton is the literal devil .

1734 0 i ca n't imagine the media shitshow that would ensue if they successfully impeached a second clinton .
1735 0 disagree , clearly liberals and democrats like these violent tactics
1736 1 yeah i 'm sure being a pushover like bernie attracts the general population much more .
1737 0 this implied threat is exactly the reason why people more prone to violence from all sides will be more likely to be drawn to trump rallies .
1738 1 # let 's protest reason and logic @ a bernie rally !
1739 0 you know trump is a billionaire , he could be paying people to go after him and make it look like he 's under attack to bolster his fan base .
1740 1 yeah , the guy singing kum ba yah during his rallies is organizing violence
1741 1 agreed
1742 0 nah , they 're not white .
1743 1 joe did a great job stumping for mccain , i 'm sure trump is pumped about this endorsement
1744 0 good to see joe found a way to become relevant again .
1745 0 then do we need gun laws , or do we really need some breeding restrictions ?

1748 1 what a novel thought .
1749 0 translation : `` the people need to stay out of politics and leave it to the corporate elite ! ''
1750 1 not unless bernie is gon na win !
1751 1 yes , i 'm sure a couple lame ddos attempts on his website will completely dismantle him , just like tearing down campaign flyers dismantled campaigns before the internet .

1774 0 you mean the majority of them that actually support clinton ?
1775 0 trump isnt bringing freedom
1776 1 yes because a political primary race is the equivalent of fucking braveheart .
1777 0 33 % of bernie supporters did not vote for bernie , either .
1778 1 make that 66 % , i will not vote for clinton either !
1779 1 but do n't vote for trump because he never talks about the fact that `` big american corporations no longer make many products in the united states '' .
1780 0 i feel like people are using trade as a scapegoat for the major changes that automation has brought ( and will continue to bring ) in the future .
1781 1 oh no what a shame we really needed another boring debate

1813 0 he should have said , could n't .
1814 1 the op is crazy
1815 1 oh sure , cause god forbid our politicians do n't jump when israel asks .

1834 1 glad we elected the nra to be president in 2008 and 2012 .
1835 1 maybe in addition to the cleveland police , they can get reenforcements from chicago , baltimore and phoenix ?
1836 0 will donald 's goons be on-site to help enforce order ?

2395 0 this article is ridiculous , but voting records in a republican-dominated government is not a good gauge on how liberal someone is .
2396 1 but anyone who supports any universal health care system besides single-payer is a republican , did n't you hear ?
2397 1 yes but also the only true liberal .
2398 0 lol .
2399 0 on foreign policy , clinton is no moderate .
2400 1 yep , hillary 's stance on guns has centrist republican written all over it .
2401 0 it will continue to fall , but she will still get the nomination due to name recognition .
2402 1 leave it to old non-white non-liberal women to f this up
2403 0 hillary would overthrow any government as long as there was a business interest .
2404 1 on the one hand , it would be a socialist country that is pacifist and anti-corporatist which makes it an easy target for the cia , on the other hand bernie 's a jew and we all know how much hillary loves israel
2405 1 surely this will affect the polling numbers .
2406 0 better than politics
2407 1 this , of course assumes the highly unlikely outcome of bernie sanders losing the primary .
2408 0 oh shit , please do n't let her pick her dad .
2409 0 whitest arrest ever
2410 1 oh no see ... those protesters are just paid activists .
2411 1 how will clinton come back from this ?
2412 0 god , this sub is desperate .

2416 0 can anyone tell me what 's illegal about this ?
2417 0 so what ?
2418 1 keep patting yourself on the back bernie , mentioning how little money you make or how you do n't have a super pac definitely makes you the best candidate
2419 0 lmao voter fraud allegation predictions were right on the money .
2420 1 nobody saw that coming
2421 0 drumpf is big government of a different variety , though .
2422 1 trite dismissal , i 'm shocked , just shocked .
2423 0 he 'll tell them to cut it out .
2424 1 good thing he got to it in a timely manner
2425 1 well it looks like another failed attempt at socialism ... maybe if you try it in america it will work better
2426 0 call state capitalism `` socialism '' brehs
2427 1 you do n't say
2428 0 hahaha yes
2429 1 really , this should have been an obvious win given how new york is a southern state .
2430 0 just another mostly black state bordering georgia .
2431 1 welcome to the apocalypse , people .
2432 0 it has been foretold by the gods .
2433 1 and i 'm sure it was fair and square
2434 0 new york -- front-runners donald trump and hillary clinton swept to victory with ease in tuesday 's new york primary , with trump bouncing back from a difficult stretch in the republican contest and clinton pushing closer to locking up the democratic nomination .
2435 1 wow what a surprise
2436 0 do people in new york not realize that bernie met the pope ?
2437 0 yes , but hillary won majority of the voters in ny .
2438 1 bernie had less votes but he should still win !
2439 1 it 's over guys , wrap it up and kneel before the queen .
2440 0 just
2441 1 seems fair
2442 0 sounds about typical
2443 0 what 's wrong with andrew jackson ?
2444 1 yeah so when i heard this suggestion years ago it was her too i bet
2445 0 fourth amendment ?
2446 1 i 'm glad the cops have nothing better to do than kick a woman out of the woman 's restroom .
2447 1 thanks for waiting until after new york to say this
2448 0 trying to make himself palatable to the berniecrats in case hillary is indicted and the dnc throws it to him ?
2449 0 and everyone knows the best way to encourage people to join your side is to lecture them about what you perceive as their faults
2450 1 but what about unifying the party !
2451 0 he says this , but does actually think hillary would have gotten those votes ?
2452 1 oh , go ahead and blame the millennials ... for not doing thy bidding as you wanted them to !
2453 1 stein/bernie 2016
2454 0 who ?
2455 1 so then they vote again right ?
2456 0 so fucked
2457 1 come on guys , lucy flores is n't a real democrat , bernie does n't support down ballot democrats .
2458 0 she looks like a meme
2459 0 okay well he 's worth a lot still
2460 1 trump lies to puff up his ego , who woulda thought ?
2461 1 but only people who are n't employed and are looking for free handouts support bernie .
2462 0 so money in politics is ok as long as it 's for my candidate or from companies i like .
2463 0 hrc supporter here : it 's * adorable *
2464 1 it 's disgusting and should n't happen but oh well .
2465 0 how much did clinton pay you for that one ?
2466 1 but that 's not astroturfing , nor is it shilling , because astroturfing and shilling only happens when someone disagrees with me .
2467 0 we do n't need 23 types of comments when children are going hungry in this country !
2468 1 this is the woman we should all be voting for !
2469 1 guns keep america safe once again .
2470 0 so a normal night in atlanta ?
2471 0 go after the superiors too .
2472 1 well at least they 're getting suspended !
2473 0 the only reason she and her peers are so adamant about gun control is that they know when the people have had enough , they 'll be the first assholes dragged to the guillotine .
2474 1 this administration is doing a great job with that ... keep up the good work and soon we 'll be saying thanks hillary instead of thanks obama
2475 0 i like to think that the government had absolutely nothing to do with it and now theyre like `` well fuck now they think we did it ... ''
2476 1 what an amazing coincidence .
2477 0 he knows a compliant republican when he buys one .
2478 1 but hillary and bernie are essentially the same !
2479 0 the phrasing is great
2480 1 she 's been handling these kinds of attacks her whole political life and that makes her the most qualified candidate ever
2481 1 this wo n't get downvoted .
2482 0 the irony of a war hawk campaigning for stricter gun laws is clearly lost on dunham .
2483 1 shocker !
2484 0 luckily you can travel to any part of rhode island from any other part of rhode island in 15 minutes .
2485 1 conspiracy !
2486 0 the members were too young to be on facebook ?
2487 0 i do n't know how fb works but would n't fb be responsible for taking down groups without a real reason ?
2488 1 the conspiracy theorists have really taken the lead in the sanders camp , good to see rational thought prevailing over there !
2489 0 you should really pick a third party that you 're interested in instead , i believe that if any of them gets 15 % they get public funding and get to participate in future presidential debates
2490 1 that should accomplish a lot
2491 1 that 'll show her
2492 0 so you 'll go full bore conservative because your preferred candidate did n't win the primary ?
2493 1 i look forward to our first native american vice president !
2494 0 uh , you might want to check today 's polls ?
2495 1 just make sure she does n't vote .
2496 0 i 'm pretty sure she 's probably in the bible somewhere .
2497 1 north carolina seems to have its priorities right
2498 0 government : the more the merrier .
2499 1 it is all going to be cleared up in one week , i promise next week it , whatever the `` it '' is will be delivered and the candidate hillary clinton will be out .
2500 0 `` this latest action by the fbi may ... '' article asserts no particular actions being taken by the fbi .
2501 1 sounds like a good excuse for more gop tax cuts !
2502 0 watching the bigots cost their state millions of dollars is wonderful .
2503 1 the question is , should bernie apologize ?
2504 0 bernie sanders walked to work one day and dropped a milky way wrapper in a municipal garbage can , which caused a subtle shift in the direction of the wind that day that caused eric garner to draw * just * little enough breath such that he died !
2505 1 the calendar is favorable to sanders though
2506 0 it 's not close to being over , he just needs to win california by 80 points
2507 0 if bernie gave a damn about this country he would concede tonight .
2508 1 clearly it was the fact that those damn supporters that took down bernie facebook pages !
2509 0 is that with or without super-delegates ?
2510 1 it says sanders still has a chance !
2511 1 because bernie supporters are sexist too , right ?
2512 0 well someone has to and hillary openly said she would n't .
2513 1 because he was totally going to win it otherwise .
2514 0 `` do n't worry lyin ' ted , i got oregon , you keep telling those hoosiers about the basketball ring . ''
2515 0 probably an endorsement from the indiana governor .
2516 1 a terrible human being and a terrible business person are just what this country needs right now .
2517 1 wonder why drudge report or breitbart have n't reported on this at all today ?
2518 0 if ted still had any chance left , he just blew it with this nomination .
2519 0 a moral economy is a moral society .
2520 1 time for the republicans to figure out how to prevent highly educated people from voting .
2521 0 hey look , it 's inquisitr doing another `` hillary did something illegal '' article .
2522 1 by all means , let 's elect this woman president .
2523 1 this is hard hitting journalism at it 's finest
2524 0 this is from freebeacon so is about as reliable as a fortune cookie , but ... ... hot sauce bottles are heavy , man , especially for an old lady to have to carry .
2525 1 do n't worry , i 'm just it was just a mistake like when his campaign was saying carson dropped out and to vote for cruz .
2526 0 luckily he named fiorina as his vp , so that will distract people from a colossal fuck up with another colossal fuck up .
2527 0 sky is blue ?
2528 1 not honest hill
2529 1 `` it 's all his violent rhetoric .... ''
2530 0 `` his words forced me to trash a cop car ... i 'm innocent . ''
2531 0 bernie should say he will run as an independent if hillary does n't release the transcripts
2532 1 gee ralph , have we thanked you for the bush administration lately ?
2533 1 im with her !
2534 0 is there somewhere i can see which politicians voted which way on this ?
2535 0 we named the dog indiana .
2536 1 yeah ... all the other well-known polls are showing trump has a 2-9 % lead , but we better listen to this one poll that nobody 's ever heard of before .
2537 1 i 'm sure this will turn out to be real
2538 0 how convenient that two females out of the blue bring about a child rape allegation after what 20+ years .
2539 1 seems like chomsky and hersh agree ... if i were the establishment , i would n't worry about it , since they 've never been right before .
2540 0 a mobilized force that could change the country ... if only they bothered to vote .
2541 0 did n't mention 32 trillion in offshore money being brought back into the economy and taxed when the loopholes are close .
2542 1 just remember , anything is better than hillary 's neoliberal policies which basically copy germany !
2543 1 this does n't support the idea that clinton in unelectable , do n't vote away !
2544 0 i like to see these even if trump is losing , it will be fun to watch them change over the next 6 months
2545 0 if we knew what everyone 's best interest were , why have elections ?
2546 1 no dude , the stupid black voters in the south ( conservative states that do n't matter ) do n't know whats best for them
2547 0 palin , stalin whats the difference .
2548 1 well jesus was a big supporter of torture so it 's probably no one in the conservative party
2549 0 when i grow up , i want to have a union job with the state , so i can make people pay me more and have retirement benefits greater than my salary .
2550 1 thank you unions .
2551 0 if i take them up on this offer does that make me a communist ?
2552 1 secret muslim conspiracy imo .
2553 0 if an average american defaults on a home , it 's because of some moral lacking on their part ; if a rich american defaults on a home , it 's brilliant strategy .
2554 1 obviously , these were all rich black people .
2555 0 is there any piece of liberal propaganda garbage that redditors do n't vote up ?
2556 1 i 'm so glad this comes from a source that 's non-partisan and clearly understands economics .
2557 0 clinton was a secret muslim too ?
2558 1 well , he did n't assassinate obama bin biden , did he ?
2559 0 yup , we elected him to solve all the problems and instead he keeps blaming everyone else for things he inherited .
2560 1 which is ridiculous since he should n't be in his position because of his kenyan birth .
2561 1 republican party is such a great political party that every republican should be very very proud .
2562 0 their base will be energized by this .
2563 1 just so everyone knows , he is really a republican because republicans the only ones who are completely corrupt .
2564 0 anyone else think that term limits for the legislative branch would go a long way toward cleaning up these scandals ?
2565 1 well they are the job creators
2566 0 surely obama will not let this fly .... sarcasm *
2567 1 yeah well , i 'm sure once he became president he became aware of some new information and so this all makes sense .
2568 0 score another for the koch brothers .
2569 1 wow , i had no idea robert gates was such an awful anti-semite .
2570 0 israeli spies stole economic data from the us that created a 30bn $ deficit and cost us like 100k jobs or something like that wish i could find the source
2571 0 how so ?
2572 1 it 's worth nothing that there are no uncivil jerks in the federal government .
2573 1 well ... there it goes ... welcome to communism i guess .... people will really miss their freedoms .
2574 0 they can call it corporate jets all they want but it 's more than just those it also will fuck small airplanes .
2575 0 as someone who does n't watch much of the tv news ... are they still all sucking bachmann 's dick , or is she seen as irrelevant now ?
2576 1 you mean perry in 1st , romney in 2nd , and bachmann following up behind ?
2577 0 al qadea were guests of the taliban , by islamic tradition and afghani tribal tradition they could n't just `` offer '' bin laden to the us government .
2578 1 but ... but ... who would be our `` enemy '' ...
2579 1 as someone who 's had his balls fondled before a flight , all i can say is : do n't you dare !
2580 0 he is about to find out it is far easier to create a monster than it is to kill one .
2581 0 how about instead of giving tax breaks to `` job creators '' so they can create jobs , we give tax breaks to `` job creators '' after they create jobs ?
2582 1 but it is n't fair !
2583 1 shocking .
2584 0 as long as the washington liberals keep trying to take my guns , the teaparty are correct .
2585 1 guns do n't kill people .
2586 0 when was that idea ever a good one ?
2587 0 they only thank the soldiers that they can use for political gain .
2588 1 oh but i 'm sure he was too busy having all that gay sex to serve his country .
2589 0 perfect , you can buy a car and drive over the border into canada and hopefully theyll give you health care
2590 1 it 's a good thing that big healthcare `` reform '' passed and lowered the cost of healthcare for everyone .
2591 1 it is a great news for republicans : instead of worrying about the cost of pension , support and health coverage , the soliders sort the problem by themselves !
2592 0 before you get up in arms , do the math - the suicide rate of soldiers is not statistically different than that of civilians
2593 0 bill should just take some personal responsibility .
2594 1 typical liberal media bias
2595 1 totally dumb , he should only agree to do this if obama shows his dental records to prove he 's not an alien , or something .
2596 0 i agree .
2597 0 four years later and we still hear from palin at least once a week .
2598 1 glad to see actual politics discussed here .
2599 1 fox should have just prayed the hurricane away , then that would really get obama !
2600 0 i feel that violence is never , ever the answer , no matter the circumstances , lets tar and feather these people
2601 0 i got ta imagine this is definitely making the christmas letter .
2602 1 see the reps were right voter fraud is a danger to be taken seriously !
2603 0 in ohio we trust .
2604 1 usa beacon of democracy
2605 0 just because `` washington '' and wall street both begin with the letter `` w '' does n't mean they are the same entity .
2606 1 talk about reversed stereotypes
2607 0 it also states that the machines switched obama for romney ....... looks like the tag line takes the cake though .
2608 1 and so professionally without sensationalism
2609 1 ah yes , world net daily , a balanced and sane look at the country 's political climate from people with integrity and an interest in the truth .
2610 0 someone please tell me that is sarcasm .
2611 1 your facts and science have no place here .
2612 0 and yet , the baseball people still wo n't listen to this
2613 1 how can it possibly be that this intelligent , sweet woman * * lives alone * * ?
2614 0 in the video description she says she offers her opinion then disables comments and call everyone else worthless , yup idiot .
2615 1 i do n't understand how this could be , the media kept telling me he was a hack !
2616 0 math over opinion any day .
2617 1 yeah rpmnet would never do that
2618 0 a confirmation that women , poor , and homosexuals are people too and rich white guys are n't the only ones that matter , more like .
2619 1 the important thing to remember is that it is wrong to say that racism motivates hatred towards the president , and that the image of a black man hanging is equally not racist .
2620 0 wow , i thought i lived in a racist shithole .
2621 1 just so long as the food banks do n't get it , its all good .
2622 0 what are the odds that karl rove will be found dead , hanging from a bridge ?

2645 0 i 'm going to miss allen , but at least we still have michele bachmann to laugh at .

2648 0 the gop 's never ending war on `` reality '' .
2649 1 and if the republicans can help him out , then all the better , amiright ?

2653 1 they should feel honored to be burned to death making cheap shit to be sold by the great walmart corporation !
2654 0 are people still buying this stuff ?
2655 0 considering his terrible record of prosecuting people leaking info this is interesting .
2656 1 meaningless until he stops personally constructing fema death camps by hand
2657 1 well , america showed it does n't care about family , so why should he ?
2658 0 bitch should n't have mocked him .
2659 1 problem solved .

2667 1 only communists believe in public roads .
2668 0 well public control of production * is * socialism , but libertarians say many forms of taxation is theft , not spending .

2694 0 could any millionaires out there tell me why you would need an extra 10k off the backs of poor people ?
2695 0 how about obama using the espionage act to spy on journalists who have been political opponents , is that fair game ?
2696 1 the narrative seems to be to let christie off the hook , you'all are all just liberals picking on the poor man .
2697 1 obviously dianne feinstein is an anti-semite and a racist
2698 0 `` cool story , bro '' -israel
2699 0 they created a bunch of code words associated with the bikini bridgegate , so that they could talk about something important but non-public that happened last week .

2701 1 so we 're just supposed to let blacks and messicans vote ?
2702 0 the us is the only first world country that does n't require someone to prove they are a citizen before allowing them to vote in a public election .
2703 1 that explains the bloody carnage happening in colorado right now .

2711 0 ai n't privatization just grand !
2712 1 fraud in government contracts , shocked , shocked i tell you !
2713 0 the war part was added by that link , he was saying that the propagandizing of today shares some similarities with the propagandizing of the pre-war nazi 's you dont have to have a bumper sticker `` eat the rich '' to campaign for higher taxes on the wealthy , thats just preaching hate .
2714 1 just like genocide .
2715 1 spending our way out of recession has been working so well for him .

3549 1 it 's not the muslim terrorists killing people you should be afraid of , no it 's trump for saying he 's going to do something about it .
3550 0 at least they used a different verb - have n't seen `` laces into '' for a while .

3647 1 who could have possibly predicted sanders supporters would n't support clinton ?
3648 0 maybe they should have thought about that before rigging elections and using the media as their party propaganda arm .
3649 1 she did n't need the security because she knew she would be getting a `` security inquiry ''
3650 0 yeah , this is getting worse for hillary by the day and she is going to drag down a lot of innocent state staffers who were just following her top aides ' directives .

4059 0 i like how he praises the idea of executing people without any regard for their 'rights ' how the hell can any constitutionalist support this guy
4060 1 we could have saved 50 billion ...
4061 0 wow , cnn with a headline like that ... maybe there 's hope after all .
4062 1 i forgot that hillary , not comey , made the decision not to recommend charges being brought .
4063 1 i 'm sure after he `` answers '' all of these questions it will all be put the rest and we will never ever hear anything about it ever again .
4064 0 ah , yes , i was waiting for the blowhards to grandstand when this came down ... what a farce .
4065 1 yes , he failed them , he has to go .

4086 1 later trump said he was confusing it with the 12 commandments .

4118 1 sounds like a balanced opinion
4119 1 but trump won the nevada primary by a lot !
4120 0 i still remember when trump had 'no forseeable path to cinch the nomination ' .
4121 0 people will say his campaign is a disaster until he wins in november , then they 'll just say all the millions of people who voted for him are racist , sexist , xenophobic , islamophic , homophobic , transphobic , and anti-semitic to explain why he won .

4140 0 why do polls include do n't know/no answer options ?
4141 0 i wonder how many times people will leave the `` reddit said '' comment and think it 's original or that it makes sense .
4142 1 but remember , hillary not hitting bcc when sending emails is way worse than this
4143 1 i 'm with her , because there just is n't enough corruption in government these days .
4144 0 i very much like to start my day with coffee and a bit of good news .

4150 0 strange how that happens .

4895 0 liberal shill .... oh wait
4896 1 stein must have gotten some of that sweet ctr cash .

4898 1 that would be different .
4899 0 true , but that 's a personal choice to make , since it 's an anticipated burden , and if a parent feels that they are not willing to deal with such a hardship and are within the first trimester ( or the legal period for abortions ) of their pregnancy , let them make that choice .

4929 0 hahahahahahaha !
4930 1 trump being a master golfer and the proud owner of multiple golf courses , he 's seen through your shill tactics and has realized the lower the poll ratings the better !
4931 1 another hilarious trump joke
4932 0 none of us are surprised at what comes out of trump 's mouth but this one is really fucked up .
4933 0 the great unfriending of 2016
4934 1 we should put them on some sort of list .
4935 0 and it would only take 1 second amendment folk-person to stop trump .
4936 1 oh come on guys , he was just kidding !
4937 0 the second amendment was intended to avoid having to maintain a standing army .
4938 1 for the militias to be able to hunt under government orders , obviously .
4939 1 13 articles in this sub 's first 2 pages ... should n't we make a megathread to organize this properly ?
4940 0 that 's funny , considering most people i have met have been considering the same thing if he were to win .... what a mess we are in .
4941 1 so presidential .
4942 0 man , this has been the best trump reality show yet !
4943 0 yea lets remove whats left of accountability with political contributions .
4944 1 sure , because wiping out what is left of accountability is a great idea !
4945 0 far cry from the 'trump will rip hillary apart in the debates ' attitude of just a couple months ago

4950 1 oh yeah you 'll definitely see a massive uprising of neo nazis and white supremacists when trump wins

4952 0 ctr , assemble !
4953 1 but he speaks his mind , that 's why he 's great !
4954 0 that 's pretty much every politician though , he 's just slightly more incoherent .
4955 0 unfortunately this will do little to tarnish hillary 's approval right now amidst the befuddlement of the donald with his remarks from yesterday .
4956 1 who would have thought that judicial watch was working for the russians
4957 1 good luck .
4958 0 she should use her previous defense of a child rapist as a selling point .
4959 0 first time ive ever agreed with trump lmao
4960 1 god i hope he has someone write a `` how to make friends and influence people '' book for him .
4961 0 how could someone ( secret service or not ) just idly use their key to turn off an elevator then not know what happened ?
4962 1 do n't worry guys , they will run the country just fine
4963 1 oh right , that six-figure clinton foundation payment that totally exists and definitely was not an easily discredited scam .

5763 1 that 's so weird , given her track record of total honesty and transparency
5764 0 it does n't help that you 've got `` news '' sites like salon screaming about how this is about sexism , and nothing else .

5786 1 good thing we have a robust , healthy economy with very little wealth disparity and massive room for upward movement ready and rearing to go to take these people in !
5787 0 flu can cause pneumonia , but if that is the case with hillary , bill should have said that because `` clinton has pneumonia '' has been in the headlines for days .
5788 1 it was n't an accident or the msm would have edited his comment hillary has the vapors .
5789 1 the economy is being rigged to make obama look good .
5790 0 it 's honestly just so-so
5791 0 good , maybe some people are finally realizing that if trump wins the election , it was the media that elected him .
5792 1 which is why you should follow true sources , like alex jones and breitbart .
5793 1 it sure is a good thing colin powell and hillary clinton encrypted their emails because we ca n't read them now .

5802 1 wow ... a real intellectual powerhouse , just like the old man .
5803 1 but hillary told me obama was n't swayed by wall street money in all the debates !
5804 0 it 's a real shame warren has taken a sudden interest in breaking bench pressing records
5805 0 but what does ja rule think ?
5806 1 2 completely relevant musical acts .
5807 0 trump stop following 1920s economic policy that died with hoover
5808 1 you mean the foreign brands manufactured in the us , or the us brands manufactured in a foreign country ?

5821 1 well i 'm sure the media will be satisfied now and stop hectoring him
5822 0 this is just fucking infuriating .
5823 0 because a lot of people think abortion in wrong in [ current year ] ?
5824 1 but he 's really a social liberal !
5825 0 its almost like they should have punished the people at the bank instead of the bank itself .
5826 1 but we do n't need glass steagle , right ?
5827 1 why would a nuclear kuwait , uae , oman , bahrain , saudi arabia , and egypt be a threat to israeli security ?
5828 0 clinton is their puppet though not sure which is worse .
5829 0 yeah , because `` it 's her turn ! ''
5830 1 in a completely fair and unbiased primary !
5831 0 he did so non ironically too

5833 1 and stein was so close !

5838 1 yes , and when trump loses by one vote you can thank jesus .
5839 0 dear god , how can people take this guy seriously let alone vote for him ?
5840 1 i guess chipotle wo n't be the only place to distribute e. coli .
5841 1 yet the military is woefully underfunded and we need to increase spending .
5842 0 but let 's worry about welfare fraud some more .
5843 1 surely this time will work
5844 0 good luck with that .
5845 0 he paused an interview to watch cnn 's coverage of him .
5846 1 yeah , i 'm sure trump is the only candidate in history to pay attention to what the media is saying about him .
5847 0 you never know , after all trump and pence say some crazy shit
5848 1 but the flair says `` no satire '' !
5849 1 i 'm sure milo & amp ; amp ; team over at breitbart will be skewering pence for the suggestion that the world must cater to whatever happens to offend him .
5850 0 talibangelist are like this .
5851 0 the ap
5852 1 oh yeah totally presidential of him .
5853 1 but hillary only wants 12 bucks for the minimum wage , she is a republican , i 'm going to vote johnson , he is closer to bernie in all policies
5854 0 at this point , the only conclusion i can draw is that trump is trying to throw the race .
5855 0 now i 'm just wondering whom he intends to shoot in the face .
5856 1 oh , now i 'm totally convinced .
5857 1 because birth certificates were not a thing when he was born .
5858 0 where were you born ?
5859 1 so , it was a slow day ?
5860 0 and the regressive alt right could n't care less , they want a billionaire elitist criminal in the wh .
5861 1 yeah the dnc picked a horrible candidate .
5862 0 yes , they selected their nominee ... by choosing not to ignore 3.6 million votes and wins in 10/11 of the top states by population .
5863 0 federal employees breaking federal law .
5864 1 hospitals should hire more stoned surgeons .
5865 0 i think stiglitz only gave him that because there was n't anything lower .
5866 1 noble prize is rigged
5867 1 that will help millennials for sure .
5868 0 hillary clinton may cost hillary clinton the election
5869 1 this looks like an even better personal blog ; one that masquerades as a commercial publication .
5870 0 why does it keep getting deleted ?
5871 1 maybe if we allow for police torture things will get better !
5872 0 i totally agree - we need to profile police or else dogs/people may be unnecessarily shot .
5873 0 these cops should be punished with paid vacation and transfers to another precinct !
5874 1 cops can do no wrong though , at least , that 's what blue lives matter & amp ; all lives matter activists tell me .
5875 0 if he was so popular , then do explain , why he failed to win his primary ?
5876 1 shame he did n't run for president or something .
5877 1 yeah berniebros , this is your fault !
5878 0 just like fiorino , right barry-o ?
5879 1 there they go throwing the hitler card , this will totally make me vote clinton after seeing trump called hitler for the 70th time
5880 0 literally hitlerian .
5881 0 they were very organized after the murder .
5882 1 `` his hands were up in a threatening way ''
5883 1 polls are now fake again .
5884 0 funny how every poll favorable to trump makes the front page and every poll favorable to clinton gets buried .
5885 0 has he tried reading the fucking constitution ?
5886 1 yeah , we want this guy to be the defender of the constitution .
5887 1 yes , the lifelong new york liberal is going all in to ban abortion .
5888 0 last ditch effort to lose maybe ?
5889 1 but hillary coughed , clearly that 's more important !
5890 0 i saw david farenthold on multiple msnbc shows , so they 've spent about equal time on this story and the skittles thing .
5891 0 i 'm willing to bet this ends in nothing happening .
5892 1 but hillary helps treat aids patients , so they 're about equal .
5893 1 im not convinced until we find a reddit account post that confirns this .
5894 0 exactly , no one has been able to show that the clinton foundation has done anything illegal .
5895 1 that 's because 81 % of americans are anti-semitic neo nazis .
5896 0 82.5 % of polls & amp ; statistics are fake
5897 1 it 's a good thing all of her scandals are done and there are no more emails or anything left
5898 0 hey karl did obama win ohio in 2012 ?
5899 1 well , china built a wall , and you do n't see any mexicans running around there do ya ?
5900 0 i think that wall was built a long time ago brah .
5901 0 another war criminal trusting hillary.the only ones who still dont support her are dick cheney and george bush .
5902 1 clearly a paid shill
5903 1 because when i think of hillary , i think of ethics .
5904 0 as opposed to the morally sound bush and obama presidencies ?
5905 1 right , because until this happened they had the pretense of impartiality .
5906 0 so the suck and swallow before that was a-ok ?
5907 0 so then trump right in saying that blacks are worse off now than at any time in recent memory .
5908 1 stop your identity politics they only tear us apart !
5909 0 is that compared to the irish slaves that outnumbered them or the black slave owners that bred more black slaves ?
5910 1 say what you will , but black unemployment was at record lows during slavery .
5911 0 this author apparently does n't know what the word `` millennial '' means .
5912 1 and they say fearmongering is exclusive to the right
5913 0 sometimes i think donald trump is just seeing how much childish and immature behavior the american voter will tolerate .
5914 1 did n't he copy her on the whole birther thing ?
5915 1 well that 's a good way to win hearts and minds to your cause .
5916 0 top kek .
5917 1 trump surrounds himself with only the best people !
5918 0 he 's black , he 's allowed to .
5919 0 i love that the one black guy has an expression on his face like , `` what the fuck , dude , why did you bring me here ? ''
5920 1 i saw at least 1 black guy in that picture idk what you guys are all upset about
5921 0 lois lerner is still laughing about the time darrell issa threatened to jail her .
5922 1 sounds fair and well reasoned .
5923 1 great endorsement !
5924 0 einstein might disagree
5925 0 mostly i 'm just surprised to learn that i was n't the only jewish gop donor
5926 1 funny i thought that the `` short guys in yarmulkes '' would love him .
5927 1 everyone knows the wall street journal is a liberal rag .
5928 0 and after they debates it 'll be a 10 point lead over trump
5929 1 ah , the polls have gone from trustworthy back to skewed in favor of clinton i see
5930 0 is that a lot ?
5931 0 trump knows more than the generals .
5932 1 stripes is liberal propaganda .
5933 0 so out of convenience , not conviction .
5934 1 oh well , then , if it 's become an inconvience to trump , we just all forget that happened , right ?
5935 1 do n't worry , mexico will take care of the debt
5936 0 of course , this will be offset by the value of the winning we 'll do .
5937 0 so does hillary .
5938 1 but your opponent is `` crooked hillary , '' so why are you the one who is so worried about fact-checking , don ?
5939 0 this will be deleted any second now
5940 1 whitey had it coming
5941 0 and the smears start .
5942 1 well it was okay to gun him down then !
5943 0 yeah jus one of a million reasons not to vote for this conman !
5944 1 omg so a liberal organization 's `` study '' scores trump 's plan negatively !
5945 0 considering it is rump that ordered his people to start this , that is asinine .
5946 1 i mean , obama * did * found isis , so it is n't surprising .
5947 1 wow , the conspiracy is even bigger than we thought .
5948 0 next trump headline , `` i know more about physics than hawking ''
5949 1 you know who else did n't drink alcohol ?
5950 0 is n't that a good thing
5951 0 it appears the_donald is milking this angle for all it 's worth .
5952 1 well , clearly , she can do that because she is the lizard queen .
5953 0 political hack
5954 1 the progressive case for clinton is overwhelming !
5955 1 i 'm sorry nope - hillary clinton has n't been a complete paragon of liberal purity and has n't always supported everything bernie told me that i should support since the beginning of time so i wo n't fall for this blatant pandering
5956 0 please share this with friends , when clinton dies something right , progressives need to know asap .
5957 0 there was no drugs in america before obama .
5958 1 this is why colorado has become a burning hellscape of violence .....
5959 1 yes everyone knows african americans ca n't be civilized
5960 0 in the article there is no clinton inviting chaos .
5961 1 how will we ever fix the problem if we do n't stop talking about it ?
5962 0 he is mad because it is a distraction from him trying to screw over women and gay people .
5963 1 of course not , because it makes him uncomfortable when he 's made aware of his privilege , and that 's the * real racism * .
5964 0 well , he 's wrong
5965 0 did they have anthony weiner and bill pick the girls ?
5966 1 women and men are equals and should be treated thusly ... unless you start saying mean things , then they cry .
5967 1 sexists
5968 0 she is winning , what polls are they looking at ?
5969 1 cuz that will calm things down .
5970 0 what a shocker , you reap what you sow le .
5971 1 shh , let the smart people interpret the numbers for you .
5972 0 or how are the determining the sample
5973 1 well black unemployment is much much higher under president obama than it was under slavery .
5974 0 which proves conclusively that most 8 year-olds are smarter and better informed than deplorable donald and his miscreant minions .
5975 0 that 's not at all what he said , op .
5976 1 i 'm shocked , shocked that a president of the united states would even suggest being a responsible , law-biding partner in the global community of nations .
5977 1 oh this thread is going to be filled with tons of well argued points from subject experts well versed in law , immunity deals , and everything regarding the case .
5978 0 trump just called for gun confiscation without due process ... but omg another email story
5979 1 standard when conducting a security review .
5980 0 does n't the fact that these people around clinton did get immunity indicate the fbi was trying to build a case against hillary ?
5981 1 trump is famous for his humble nature , i 'm sure he just donated the money anonymously .
5982 0 so * that 's * why pence said donald 's donated 100s of millions to charity , he was confusing him with zuckerberg !
5983 0 it 's not that i think she 's wrong , i just really do n't want 4-8 more years of potus involving themselves in local issues like this .
5984 1 hillary - he could have been my son !
5985 1 so the electorate can make well informed decisions .
5986 0 `` transparent ''
5987 1 well if kim kardashian is voting for him damn i will too
5988 0 well if that 's not enough reason to vote for hillary right there .... though , surprise , people whose only success was reality tv are sticking together .
5989 0 good .
5990 1 those repubs really like democracy do n't they
5991 0 a few million just about nothings is just about something .

6004 1 i thought they did this before she announced .
6005 1 i 'm sure undecided women voters will be very impressed by this .
6006 0 hillary should get the 'central park 5 ' to join her .
6007 0 i guess that makes ted cruz an utterly amoral pathological liar .
6008 1 a 'pathological liar ' and 'utterly amoral ' yeah , but he 's a republican so it 's ok .
6009 0 the guy who said his tax plan is going to be a tax hike for the wealthy , but instead is actually the largest tax cut for the wealthy in history .
6010 1 obama cut it in half !
6011 1 but how can a fantastic business man not be admired by his peers ?
6012 0 what 's the difference between fortune 100 and 500 ?
6013 1 and hillary is the most honorable and honest candidate in human history .
6014 0 when you say modern you really disrespect previous presidential canditates .
6015 1 i 'm sure sanders supporters would be gladly supporting clinton-supporters `` protest-voting '' had he won the nomination .
6016 0 what 's a self righteous voter to do ?
6017 1 that 's very tolerant of them .
6018 0 deny an education to the ignorant ?

6032 0 it just so happens to be * the * issue ( money , bribery , corruption ) that overarches every other issue .
6033 1 of course we need more career politicians .
6034 0 during the primaries i suspected that sanders was pretty naive but since the dnc convention he 's pretty much confirmed it
6035 0 they 'll be released at 4pm october 7th
6036 1 i 'm sure this will finally be the one that does it .

6052 1 he should have , would have gone so much better for him .
6053 1 he was n't upset about her appearance , it was her lack of stamina .
6054 0 maybe she gained 400 : lbs and hacked the dnc .
6055 0 at this point i 'm realizing ... some people just want to watch the world burn
6056 1 but guys , he tells it like it is .
6057 0 trump has also been accused of rape , sexual assault , bribery , being a coke head , being racist , being xenophobic , not paying people , hiring migrant slaves , supporting global warming , using racist tenant policies , ... i could go one most of those he 's been found guilty on .

6079 1 that just proves trump was smart and ahead of his time .
6080 0 just a couple of weeks ago trump spoke to cubans in florida promising them he would reverse obama 's opening of ties with cuba and rejecting the idea of lifting the embargo .
6081 0 how smart .
6082 1 yeah , but he did n't shoot vince foster in the face so i 'm still with trump .

6101 1 short term solutions is what 's best for our future !
6102 0 uh reagan threw us into modern day debt .
6103 0 not to mention because of the electoral college stupidity , less than half a dozen states could even remotely possibly affect results by purely hypothetical voter fraud .
6104 1 because catching a couple of fraudsters is worth denying thousands their right to vote .
6105 1 ah yes , because there 's nothing that women these days like more than some good old-fashioned victim blaming .
6106 0 really scraping the bottom of the weapons barrel .
6107 1 oh no not the c word
6108 0 `` the c-word '' jesus i hate this

6117 1 yeah , he would have had to look chelsea in the eye * then * .
6118 0 sniff sniff
6119 1 trump has the best people , the best supporters , simply the best .
6120 0 pretty much every single post republican right winger confuses the constitution with a choose your own adventure book that allows people to custom build the tyrannical government that least effects them .
6121 0 waka flocka for president
6122 1 i love how his advisers were trying to get him to stay away from lewinsky and this is his response : ) who does n't want a president with the self control of a 5 year old
6123 1 but it 's not about race , because its never about race , right ?
6124 0 still have n't quite figured out why some people ca n't seem to differentiate `` politically incorrect '' from `` genuinely racist ''
6125 0 i love how much of an unrelated/non issue bill is , yet he 's obsessively brought up like he is an issue .
6126 1 yep , i wondered why he was n't at the debate

6139 0 i do n't think i can be surprised of anything this man says anymore .
6140 1 masha'allah .
6141 0 an old obese man sitting up at 3am watching porn , and tweeting about , is not the image i want in a president .
6142 1 obviously you 're not an alpha
6143 1 its not about which candidate would do the best job , its about what supporting them says about me .
6144 0 still better than the first party candidates tho lolololol
6145 1 and i bet this will be the first time in 2000 years that anything like this has happened to the bible .
6146 0 i assume it it will also be written in newspeak
6147 1 i 'm sure jesus has other , more grand plans for her .
6148 0 which means she 's running for president .
6149 1 very wise to assume one political party can solve all of our problems
6150 0 did anyone tell you that the democrats have been funding both wars and not imposing any kind of requirement to begin winding them down and/or withdrawing ?
6151 0 it 's amazing that people will continually vote for a party that is * ready and willing * to kowtow to an interest group that is holding the needs of an entire nation hostage .
6152 1 dude , all that matters is jesus !
6153 1 yes , because a teacher can overcome an entire sub-culture that encourages failure .
6154 0 schools do not exist to rescue poor kids from a culture that vilifies academic excellence .
6155 0 if you think that 's what happened , you need to start reading beyond headlines .
6156 1 but he 's a rapist , that cia plant lady who blogs about revenge said he was and everything !
6157 0 in other news : the pope is catholic , bears shit in the woods , and the sky is blue .

6165 0 first amendment rights only apply to corporate persons , not real human beings .
6166 1 they sure were right when they said that al-qaeda hates us because of our freedom .
6167 0 ... real satisfaction !
6168 1 yea speech should be controled by media companies not people .
6169 0 should be called the `` supporting children for the protection of their futures act '' , a la lamar smith .
6170 1 yeah , that 'll pass .
6171 0 just remember come november that romney values his capital investment into society so much more than he values your mom 's contribution that he is planning to give further tax breaks to people like him while increasing taxes on people like her .
6172 1 you mom obviously makes too much .
6173 0 strange in that 80 % of the deaths in black communities are young black men .
6174 1 contraception , the leading cause of death in the american community .
6175 0 `` knowledge is power ''
6176 1 them damn liberals need to quit regulating my trans-fat blood levels !
6177 0 men are actually more emotional than women .
6178 1 and do n't forget , women bleed once a month and those poor male soldiers might mistake that for a real wound .
6179 1 wait ... they left out ron paul .
6180 0 it is the holy trinity of the christian gop - fear , hate , bigotry .
6181 1 yeah , but that wo n't work over here because we 're am important country .
6182 0 old news from last july
6183 1 looks like we need to enforce those gun-free zones in government buildings !
6184 0 someone in hr should be getting fired .
6185 0 only goes to show that another market correction is long overdue
6186 1 obama , the most anti business president in history .
6187 1 want
6188 0 if none of you see the irony in this , then i do n't want to live on this planet anymore
6189 1 just what the republican party needs to deal with their lack of enthusiasm for any of the current candidates .
6190 0 well , a lot of brokers are republicans , so that got that going for 'em .
6191 0 seems chris christie should keep his mouth closed more often .
6192 1 clearly , this is a well reasoned response .
6193 1 but regulation is the source of all evil in the economy and should be completely done away with !
6194 0 as usual the losers are the consumers , who are bailing out the utility companies against any possible lost profits .
6195 0 the product of a welfare state ?
6196 1 we better get this contraceptive issue sorted out if we ever want this to improve .
6197 1 but hes 200 years old he is not as smart as our generation , i mean we have computers !
6198 0 this madison fellow sounds like some kind of troublemaker .
6199 1 what a surprise !
6200 0 i 'll get downvoted , but assange deserves it for releasing the identities of agents and if he really did assault those women .
6201 0 do they even listen to themselves when they say these things ?
6202 1 republican know all there is to know about the voter fraud and about the theft of benefits , from their own experience , so we should listen to them .
6203 0 can we sell them to the chinese ..... ?
6204 1 but the reason these states are so unhealthy , and so poor , is partly due to obamacare !
6205 1 i 'm sure the democrats are lined up to voluntarily hand over their incomes to these families in need .
6206 0 because stress , anxiety , and hunger pains really helps a kid focus on his/her schoolwork !
6207 0 would n't be news if they had n't been white .
6208 1 shut up and take it like a good law abiding `` free '' citizen
6209 0 of course there wo n't be any conflict ... so long as you only want to own the types of guns they approve of , with the kinds of magazines that they approve of and bought from the people they approve of , all of which is subject to them changing their mind .
6210 1 why the president must be insane , no one is safe until every one over the age of 5 is armed and loaded .

6219 1 stay classy aggies .
6220 0 are we really surprised ?
6221 1 makes perfect sense , just like all the heterosexual people who do the very same thing all the time .
6222 0 this is literally one of the stupidest things i 've ever heard .
6223 0 hope & amp ; change .
6224 1 seems legit .
6225 0 has issue with more men than women , ends up killing more women .
6226 1 if the people around him were armed with axes too , this would n't have happened , right ?
6227 0 but we 've always i been at war with eastasia .

6229 1 austerity is off to a good start , thanks sequestration .
6230 0 we added 125,000 immigrants last month and 175,000 college graduates to the workforce , seems to be a math problem here we need to figure out .

6234 0 selective memory mode - invoke .
6235 0 ha !
6236 1 but-but that 's aid , not welfare !

6241 1 because as we all know , gender is a choice .
6242 0 so many of these politicians ca n't think beyond their own narrow interests .
6243 1 i 'm sure the free-market will provide an alternative .
6244 0 indeed , the free market will ensure that only those who deserve to die do so .

6248 1 surely , ea is worse than these people
6249 1 you spelled tennessee wrong .

6258 0 itt people who 've never even been to a developing nation .
6259 1 b-but we 're bringing those ungrateful savages freedom ... ?
6260 0 also , it is surprising that 'freedom fighters ' became terrorists only when america got hurt .
6261 0 that 's because the islamic terrorists do n't get `` indicted '' , they get thrown in an mtvr and whisked away to gitmo .
6262 1 so what i 'm supposed to take from this is that the war on terror worked , right ?
6263 0 casualties at home = threat to us , legitimizes force/retaliation casualties abroad = apparent weakness in us retaliation , delegitimizes force/retaliation
6264 1 you have to inflame the sheeple with the appropriate images if you want them to roll over and accept having more freedom taken away .
6265 1 this has democratic party written all over it .
6266 0 `` it may be against the constitution but .... '' everything after but is bullshit .
6267 1 brilliant !
6268 0 all i can say is 'lol '
6269 1 excel is satan 's tool !
6270 0 as if scientific results will change how the right reacts ?

6280 1 you do n't understand , the left did it first , so its okay when my team does it .
6281 0 being a senator does not give one any special grace to vote against the position of their constituents to remain in good favor with the gun lobby .
6282 1 what a compelling and graceful argument .
6283 1 all you people are just clearly exaggerating with your complaints .
6284 0 the corrupt f * cks in the ny state senate like ball should get a taste of their own medicine .
6285 0 from what i understand , a high-school senior does n't have compulsory attendance to high-school ( depending on the state , not sure about mississippi ) , so what the hell was the truancy officer doing trying to corral them ?
6286 1 see , see , the christians are right , the lousy liberals are stealing their religion .
6287 0 do they really expect to win with this type of shit in 2016 ?
6288 1 yeah , why could n't we have a humble president , like george w. , or mittens .

6295 1 but the cuts will be to the corporation and the benefits will be to the people , how unamerican is this ?
6296 0 but for the gop , that is awful , as the savings is in healthcare costs for average citizens .
6297 1 right , because children are only cash cows for the state .
6298 0 all those elderly women having abortions !
6299 1 if i want news i go to an unbiased source , itar tass from russia comes to mind or xinhua from china .
6300 0 fox news misinforms their viewers .
6301 0 to go along with the `` cornhusker kickback '' and the `` louisiana purchase '' in the effort to * pass * obamacare .
6302 1 sir , i believe you mean `` gop reaches compromise with democratic senator ''
6303 1 gop to counter by insisting indians go back where they came from .
6304 0 although this might be a decent idea on its own merits , everyone knows the only reason why obama is pushing this is to register more democrat voters .
6305 1 yes , since we disagree on his drone policy that mean every other thing he does is wrong .
6306 0 when you outlaw the drones only the outlaws will have drones .
6307 0 america responds to obama that he should be ashamed to have not lived up to a single campaign promise , care more about terrorists in other countries than the citizens of his own , and placing gun control over education in his concerns of state .
6308 1 we need smart guns that read a person 's intent and mood and automatically wo n't fire .
6309 1 another republican party hero !
6310 0 rick perry to men , `` i wish i knew how to quit you . ''

6321 0 disappointed to see my representative on this list ... i will not be voting for him again .
6322 1 misleading title , someone was in favor for zero dollars .
6323 1 since this person said that it was about the video , then he obviously ca n't be one of the people behind the attack .

6386 0 the don is slowly but surely outmaneuvering all the other gop contestants there can only be one , and he is the don
6387 0 how about his raging hypocrisy ?
6388 1 yeah , since he himself did n't perform the abortions , it 's okay for him to use the `` tissues '' for necessary research .
6389 1 obviously hitlerally bribed him and this means nothing in regards to her candidacy !
6390 0 tom harkin is huge in iowa , this is the real deal
6391 0 that 's because animals and the environment are n't campaign contributors

6823 0 usually an unimpeachable source is the person who started the rumor in the first place .
6824 1 wait , was n't this same guy also in oj 's bronco back in 1994 ?
6825 1 it 's better to stop 45,000 innocent people from voting than to allow a single fraudulent vote

6850 0 so , should i turn myself in ?
6851 0 none of this really matters , the dems will gain this cycle and when the small recession hits in 2-4 years the voters are going to toss them out of power in 2020 leading to a wisconsin/michigan style congressional gerrymandering of epic proportions ensuring gop control of the house forever .

6869 1 probably just like the , if not more , insane roller coaster and bombshells they 've put on us this month .
6870 0 we wont know until the insurance comes due , that is why it is an insurance file .
6871 0 this is weak .
6872 1 another bombshell .
6873 1 i 'm so surprised that such a respectable outlet as the daily mail would just lie in their headline so blatantly

6877 0 willingness is not an expression of desire .

6881 0 he 's a bloated failure .
6882 1 he 's a great businessman .
6883 1 polls do n't mean anything

6885 1 it 's called `` business ''
6886 0 the only thing shocking about this article is that trump actually * paid * these employees .

6902 0 what a shitpost .

6911 0 this is absolutely hilarious but clearly false and fake since it reflects negatively on the don ... lol .
6912 1 rigged !
6913 0 now he only needs to get about 60 million more people to vote for him and he wins !
6914 1 the real point is that trump is going to win the election and everyone is rigging it against him , of * course *
6915 1 but when guys in white sheets do it , it 's a party
6916 0 seems legit
6917 1 i 'm sure it has nothing at all to do with money .
6918 0 so are trump supporters going to crucify her for not believing his accusers like they do with hillary for siding with bill ?
6919 1 did n't obama take all their guns ?
6920 0 would n't be a clinton administration without a catastrophic fbi confrontation with a militia .

6936 0 if donald truly thinks the election is rigged he should withdraw .
6937 1 no wonder this article is biased , it 's from the hill .

6957 1 part of the conspiracy , no doubt .
6958 0 i hope this brings about better laws and better treatment of the survivors .
6959 0 because the right 's primary electorate was deranged and the field had waaaaayy too many candidates .
6960 1 because trump rugged the primaries .

6962 1 wow kasich really brought the facts on this one .

6972 0 can those be anti-zionist threats ?

7000 1 rigged ....
7001 0 that 's just stronger evidence that it 's even more rigged , yugely rigged , let me tell you , bigly .
7002 1 because hillary is frail , weak , incompetent , and all-powerful -- all at the same time .

7008 1 biden told americans to fire a shotgun in the air .... yeah he is smart .
7009 1 to think that hillary had a plant this deep into his campaign this whole time .

7878 1 he needs to put 9/11 somewhere there !
7879 1 wrong .
7880 0 no one cares .
7881 1 that 's because a clinton victory is riggedly probable
7882 0 sadly , the only way for donald trump to be elected as the new president would be if the zookeeper that shot harambe was the democratic candidate .
7883 0 why does anyone even listen to rush anyway ?
7884 1 rush was probably trying to polish gw 's image .
7885 0 he thinks his personal politics are more important than his job .

7899 1 see , that 's why women should n't be in politics
7900 0 fuck them
7901 1 it 's because college educated white women are sexist bernie bros .
7902 0 maybe clinton should have paid her female staff as a 1:1 ratio compared to males .
7903 0 if it existed i would support it .
7904 1 yeah we need new & amp ; better journalism .. unless you disagree with my opinions then it 's just the msm being corrupt
7905 0 there 's a bright spot
7906 1 so ... nc did n't elect a governor over anti-lgbt law , but voted for a president and vp that are very anti-lgbt ... totally makes sense
7907 0 being crybullies have pushed around alot of politicians , but this one was elected because of that mentality ... time to suck it up and move forward .

7918 0 according to the gop , just wait until your wife dies and you will not have to worry about it anymore .
7919 0 romney was running against the first black president this is n't very surprising

7921 1 this is probably the best shit i 've heard all year
7922 0 he was probably very busy
7923 0 so tolerant
7924 1 nah guys , you do n't understand , it 's not a nazi thing , it 's just pennsylvania dutch .
7925 1 i feel that some mansplaining is necessary here to say that it was never ever up to them .
7926 0 hahaha , go to hell huffpo , maybe now you 'll figure out people are individuals and not faceless members of whatever disenfranchised class you put them in .
7927 0 what difference does it make ?
7928 1 i 'm sure if the situation were reversed , all trump supporters would shrug `` well that 's how it goes , she 's our fairly elected president . ''
7929 1 what wold carson know about sensing victory ?
7930 0 maybe because he realized he actually has to follow through now .
7931 0 daily reminder that this is an anti-trump story , and there are no pro-trump comments , thus proving that we 're all shills .

7952 1 i think everyone is forgetting the silent `` for brown people '' .
7953 1 sure , better than ( god forbid ) a black guy or woman .
7954 0 tough luck , maybe next time there will be other options who are not under 2 fbi investigations , get thrown in a van like a sack of potatoes after 1 hour in warm weather , did not rigged the primaries , has a message that actually means something for the common people , etc etc etc wehn bernie fills stadiums and the other candidate ca n't fill a living room without having people dragged over maybe you 'd think they got the hint

7976 0 dear bernie you are old please do n't run
7977 0 the empathy of one as well .
7978 1 no , you just think that she 's boring because of systemic sexism .

7989 0 america is going back to the 80s .
7990 1 but remember , trump loves the gays .
7991 0 this is trump playing 4d chess , he will have things he wants to pass that he knows other republicans oppose , so he will just say `` hey i 'll repeal obamacare ... if you pass this too ''
7992 1 i mentioned this around family yesterday , but thankfully they were there to quickly set me straight on why this story is completely untrue and it 's just the media twisting trump 's words .
7993 0 the owner of this site is trump 's son in law
7994 1 oh yes , we 're really going to beat trump and the gop in 2 years by accusing everyone on our side of being shills

7996 1 fossil fuel produced electro shock so that 's ok .
7997 1 'people will die ' with obamacare .

8002 0 dang good recall brother
8003 1 it was her turn !
8004 0 so i guess we are already going to forget that sanders was blackmailed and had no real chance of winning now .
8005 1 yep , nothing but risotto recipes .
8006 0 no one 's forgot that , but boy oh boy i 'd like to see trumps emails
8007 1 you know , i had n't heard one surrogate after the election mention russia , it 's like that whole argument just stopped ... i wonder why ?
8008 0 writing emails is the vilest thing a person can do .
8009 0 why would russia help trump after buying all the uranium mining rights from hillary ?
8010 1 yeah i mean it 's totally better to be a bunch of ignorant sheeple who are stupid enough to think that the establishment government has their best interests in mind and would never , ever do something so crooked as rig an election or try to cover up crimes
8011 0 please try to get video of as many of the protesters as possible , especially if they are inciting and committing violence .
8012 1 i heard if you protest for a week , the president has to step down !

8016 1 yes , he is literally hitler .
8017 1 so presidential
8018 0 at what point does this become ... whats the game with the dildo sword ? ... saints row !
8019 1 i 'm sure if we just give putin the sudetenland he will be happy .
8020 0 i 'm sure we 'd be pretty pissed if the russians placed missiles in cuba .

8022 0 fraud works i guess
8023 1 it was all a con , what a shocker
8024 0 and not even the smart ones
8025 0 it 's salty in here
8026 1 just like it takes a tax-evading billionaire to go after tax-evading billionaires .
8027 1 yeah , fuck those white people , amirite ?
8028 0 you can thank white voters for pretty much everything in america .
8029 0 at a certain point , we have to accept that we are no longer the # 1 super power of the world .
8030 1 how i love this russian prick interfering in our country and our elections .
8031 1 what a true hero she is
8032 0 seriously whats with all these people coming out of the woodwork to tell us how much shittier trump is as a person after he is pretty much cemented to be the president ?

8039 0 hate crimes indeed , like that man in chicago being pulled from his car by hooligans and viciously beaten on camera .
8040 1 oh , i 'm sure it 's just a few bad apples .
8041 1 yeah , because i believe anything the media says .
8042 0 then they should have voted .
8043 0 one thing the democrats absolutely have to be careful of when cleaning up shop is to make sure they do not get co-op 'd by rabid sjw fundamentalists .
8044 1 this will really assist in the democrats winning back the rust belt in 2020 .
8045 0 that link/article was worthless
8046 1 man , the economic anxiety must be pretty bad for this lady .
8047 1 is that what those fema camps are for ?
8048 0 fucking good ... finally !
8049 0 sears ' stock just went up
8050 1 wow how dare trump not build a concrete wall in unviable locations and instead opt for a fence
8051 0 they need to fix this shit by making id free , this will make everyone happy and the republicans can go fuck themselves .
8052 1 mission accomplished !
8053 0 this is what corruption looks like .
8054 1 i 'm sure he 'd say the same thing about chelsea running the clinton foundation in he reverse scenario .

8056 0 how much property are they going to damage today ?
8057 1 that 'll chance his policy for sure !
8058 0 do n't worry special snowflakes , those donations are going to be the only things keeping your organization alive within a couple years

8064 0 maybe harry reid should grab her by the pussy .
8065 0 so are you going to help support the unwanted children from poor mothers who ca n't get to an abortion clinic you bastard ?
8066 1 or if they ca n't go to another state , trump suggests that they find a very good , high quality staircase to fall down from .
8067 1 [ * looks back too all those times the same was said about obama * ] yeah you are totally right !
8068 0 [ ignores stated reasons and suggests no reasons ]
8069 0 what is a trump anyway ?
8070 1 oh good i was worried for a sec
8071 1 shocker
8072 0 bullshit article that was meant to smear trump
8073 0 do you also love policy prescriptions and rhetoric that function to threaten civil rights ?
8074 1 yeah , does n't being condescended to by a bunch of elites in manhattan and dc who are completely out of touch with middle america inspire you to vote democrat ?
8075 0 let the new justice department handle that instead .
8076 1 well , that otta work
8077 0 do as i say and not as i do .
8078 1 silly trump , you need to say , `` cut it out , '' to get people to stop .
8079 0 may obama is n't moving out ?

8081 1 easy , bing-watch 'west wing ' to get a crash course on how to run the white house
8082 0 probably because the role of the president has has sprawled well out of scope compared to the job description .
8083 1 nah fuck that i did n't get to see dinosaurs why should my kids get to see polar bears and penguins .
8084 0 young people should have voted .

8169 0 inb4 liberal victim blaming .
8170 1 if only hillary had n't normalized political violence by offering to pay legal fees for violent supporters
8171 1 yes let 's start hiring based on race , f * * * skills ..... which explains why white nationalists supported trump .
8172 0 there are two ways to play the race card , the way obama did it and the way bannon is doing it .
8173 0 the splc is the same organization that spent the election fighting cartoon frogs , they have no legitimacy .
8174 1 i hear at 500,000 he has to do it !

8185 0 thanks obama
8186 1 are these kind of posts allowed in this sub ?
8187 0 but he is a racist ... therefore if you are against wall street corruption then you hate black people
8188 1 jamie dimon for treasury is a great sign of that
8189 1 see it turns out things can be privately funded and the government does n't have to have its ' fingers in everything !
8190 0 can he claim those on his taxes ?

8209 1 he should fire all the republicans cause the dems want so
8210 0 everyone is calling for this , but i guess we only care if bernie says it ?
8211 1 relax we 're only a week in .
8212 0 well at least megan tried to put that douche in his place .
8213 1 to be fair , they need to stop hurting his fragile little feelings .
8214 0 i love that our bar is now so low comments like `` trump probably wont attempt to violate the first amendment rights of the people he does n't like by abusing executive power '' is considered a positive thing to say about him .
8215 0 maybe hillary should have cared about single-payer health care .
8216 1 but is n't obamacare great ?
8217 0 well herr bannon certainly has that little air about him .

8227 1 off to a great start !
8228 0 holy fuck , we 're all enrolled at trump university now .
8229 0 remember you 're not allowed to call them that or the true americans will get upset and vote against you out of spite
8230 1 do n't forget that it 's obama who was really racially divisive
8231 1 pretty sure the internment camps were why we won wwii ... right ?
8232 0 do n't worry guys : persecuting religious minorities has , historically , never been a bad thing !

8236 0 real straight shooter , that donald .
8237 1 if only there was a designer in the trump family who could pick up the slack .
8238 0 did melania even ask her to design her dresses or did this designer just dramatically `` quit '' from a job she was never even offered ?
8239 0 it 's a good thing we saved ourselves from the secret republican , hillary clinton !

8267 1 but they 're all without sin so it 's cool .
8268 0 someone who loves their neighbor as their own , unless their neighbor is anything other than a carbon copy of themselves .
8269 0 are trump hotels as gaudy as his home ?
8270 1 guys he is just a smart business man and any of you could do the exact same thing .

8275 0 same place he is now : only in john mccain 's fevered imagination .
8276 1 what a maverick
8277 0 because the hamilton `` scandal '' is a more catchy headline
8278 1 there 's much more important things to talk about , like how donald tweeted that some actor is a big meanie .
8279 0 i would give anything for a john mccain presidency at the moment .
8280 1 trump only listens to heroes .
8281 1 riiight ... not at all like trump himself .
8282 0 can we not give this bs any attention , really .
8283 1 just until we figure out what 's going on !
8284 0 i feel like america is slathered in baby oil rocketing down a double black diamond
8285 1 freedom of religion just means that you can belong to any denomination of christianity you want .
8286 0 they hate freedom of violent religions which nowadays realistically means just one .
8287 0 that 's ridiculous but true
8288 1 that 's because it 's the * wrong * faith .
8289 1 this changes * everything *
8290 0 this is an outright stolen election , if common sense and decency factor in at all .
8291 1 this justified the vote for all of those hardcore conservatives out there .

8311 0 so what you 're saying is there 's a painkiller epidemic in trump states and those folks are all about to lose whatever insurance they could possibly have hoped for ?
8312 1 well , considering ben carson 's assertion that obamacare is the worst thing since slavery , i think abolishing it is a great idea .
8313 1 it 's nice to see the enlightened commentors here offering constructive solutions to this problem and not simply contributing to it .
8314 0 it makes for awesome ad revenue when you structure every news site around comment wars .
8315 0 either this did n't happen , as the aid of the argentinian president explicitly said since they were in the room , or the president is spineless .
8316 1 but he 's not the president yet
8317 0 * these fucking amateurs , dude *

8325 1 locker room talk
8326 0 lol breitbart
8327 1 i heard he is also a first rate toilet cleaner , so having him as an ambassador would be huge as far as the hygiene of the british embassy .
8328 0 except he wo n't be an ambassador
8329 0 i 'd rather have a president fighting against the mainstream media than one colluding with it
8330 1 only if the ny times were nice to him , like trump 's friend putin , trump would have called the ny times the day after he won .

8335 0 it 's actually only going to be 1 trillion now that they wo n't have to build that moon prison to contain hillary since reconsidering prosecuting her .
8336 1 right , i 'm sure raising the minimum wage , making public colleges tuition-free , and creating a public option to save us from the aca death spiral would not `` explode '' the national debt at all ...

8340 1 just stop with your white-male agenda .

8351 1 good thing the popular vote is how we elect the president
8352 0 her lead in a metric that 's irrelevant .
8353 1 i feel america getting greater already , are n't you excited everyone ?
8354 0 is basically the kansas tax plan
8355 0 soros belongs in prison
8356 1 man , he sounds like an asshole

8478 1 i 'm beginning to sense there 's a pattern with this trump guy .
8479 0 glad to see the white house is wise enough to not blame millions of people , including americans , for the actions of one man who most likely suffered from mental illness .

8588 1 what a shock to see a politician abandon commitments and allegedly closely-held morals once in office .
8589 1 because science has a well established liberal bias .
8590 0 republican scientists are intelligent enough to know that liberals are nowhere near as tolerant as they want everyone else to be , and know that academia is overrun with libs , so they simply give the `` approved '' answer to these polls .
8591 0 there are no such mistakes , this is planned thieving by people of authority
8592 1 but the sequester is destroying our military readiness .

8612 0 i thought only his boyfriend knew graham 's fetishes .
8613 1 unfortunately , the obama administration has a secret interpretation of copyright law
8614 0 if they 're going to violate the 4th amendment , they might as well disregard every us law .
8615 1 well when you lose ted nugent , you lose the nation .
8616 0 over what ?
8617 0 few things are more rewarding than watching conservatives attack conservatives .
8618 1 and they do so because they have nothing else to do , especially since the darker skinned ones are pretty lazy
8619 1 because * that * would be an unconstitutionally broad invasion of privacy , unlike having the nsa spy on * everyone * .

8628 0 he will deliver on his promises in his third term .
8629 1 i 'm sure this is what `` rule of law '' was supposed to mean .
8630 0 this actually does n't explain why , just how .

8653 0 nsa to senators wyden & amp ; udall : because you do n't have the courage to stop us or to actually tell the public what we 're lying about .
8654 1 well to be fair ... its sort of in their job description .
8655 0 only if `` fix it later '' does n't involve killing someone .
8656 1 i 'm sure those women who would not have been able to use the services of medical facilities would agree about a chance to fix it later and not live with the consequences .
8657 0 all this means is that the republicans will now blame each other for letting the dems `` get away with benghazi '' .
8658 1 i guess we need a 15th investigation , then .
8659 0 3 fox `` news '' posts in a row ?

8661 0 while giving huge tax giveaways to wealthy corporations , i 'll bet .

8713 0 notice how obama is upset and trump just shrugs .
8714 1 usa after trump wins the election : 'horrible ' but these things happen
8715 0 and republicans tend to look more at the color in one 's wallet

8767 0 except that the democrats are the ones who are talking reality while the republicans are still denying that climate change is happening , supporting economic policies that have caused multiple recessions , trying to give the military more money after they 've already said that they do n't need any more funding , pandering to religious fundamentalists , and wanting to cut services to those that need them most
8768 1 but it makes people feel good and is n't that whats really important .
8769 0 what has surprised me about his campaign is how disciplined he is - he clearly smart as a whip

9163 1 well , it 's not like trump would ever apologise either , so does that also qualify him as someone with integrity ?
9164 0 upvote for the comment and the commenter 's name tag .
9165 1 what 's wrong with dividing the world between the us and russia ?
9166 0 not saying it 's true because i do n't know what to believe anymore , but if russia 's goal was to undermine our faith in our institutions , then it 's evidence like this that shows it worked .
9167 0 and somehow giving his companies to his kids will fix the conflict of interest ?
9168 1 this article is full of evidence .
9169 0 probably trying to squeeze in some heinous legislation before they lose the governor
9170 1 wow , what a shiny example of a legislature that totally has their shit together
9171 1 i 'm sure his business interests wo n't influence his decision making at all
9172 0 rex tillerson 's business interests are the sum quantity of his judgement .
9173 1 yeah but at the same time putin is making them hard
9174 0 trump voters side with the remnants of the kgb over american citizens .
9175 0 can you think of someone else who 's been lying a lot who should perhaps be arrested ?
9176 1 surely her arrest will get as much coverage as the hoax
9177 1 it 's always pleasant to see would be dictators * always * announce their intentions before they do something .
9178 0 sure , because nothing gets people in your side like intimidation .
9179 1 they should visit russia , it might help them appreciate how great putin is doing .
9180 0 its because these people are easily manipulated ... thats how trump/russia got them to vote for him anyways .
9181 1 withholding aid has been successful in getting north korea and cuba to change their ways also .
9182 0 meet trump 's new best bud .
9183 0 the reason the obama administration did n't do anything before the election about the russian hack is because they thought it would benefit the democrats .
9184 1 but you can ignore the fbi and the director of national inelegance .
9185 0 when you have a president-elect who routinely praises vladimir putin , talks about lifting russian sanctions , signals a willingness to recognize the crimean referendum , and suggests abandoning nato countries who do n't meet defence spending quotas , it 's going to raise some eyebrows .
9186 1 yeah , 17 us intelligence agencies have concluded that russians are behind the dnc hacks because the democrats want to delegitimization trump .
9187 1 so they used wikileaks ?
9188 0 fake news site
9189 1 itt : the cult of the donald has a couple of incredibly level headed , reasonable , and completely logical opinions .
9190 0 and her lead in the electoral college , the thing that matters , has n't changed .
9191 0 they do n't care about facts at all , they live in their own made up reality , it would be hilarious if they did n't fuck the rest of the world while they do that .
9192 1 hey , it 's not like he disputed those very allegations on camera in a debate a few weeks before the election or anything
9193 0 gop to reid : get rekt , we do n't give a shit .
9194 1 so death panels without the useless bureaucratic overhead of the panels ?
9195 0 there should be an affirmative action program for cabinet posts , this way lil wayne could be secretary of state and g-unit could head the department of defense .
9196 1 it 's cause they 're the `` best people for the job . ''
9197 0 why not use a tag that label them for what they are : lies and propaganda ?
9198 1 i do n't see this being abused at all
9199 1 yeah but `` sticking it to the washington elite '' was worth it !
9200 0 damn dog , if you ca n't keep the fox viewership happy as a republican you are fucking up bigly .
9201 0 let me add another question : `` why did you vote for someone who admitted to buy politicians ? ''
9202 1 because emails , bernie , e-m-a-i-l-s .
9203 1 i believe it
9204 0 lindsay graham says he was hacked .
9205 0 itt : people continuing to deny trump is racist and emboldens a lot of racists , and a lot of people valiantly demonstrating otherwise only to be ignored .
9206 1 that 's how you become president of * all * americans .
9207 0 i think i 'm getting the black lung , pop
9208 1 bring back coal , bring back coal , bring back hack , cough .
9209 0 this will surely be the winning strike from the left .
9210 1 guys there 's still a chance bernie can win !

9212 0 mccain for president !
9213 0 small government , big ceos
9214 1 corporations are people my friend .
9215 1 hope that we can ban muslims and deport millions !
9216 0 bush had you down ?
9217 1 we need more businessmen in government to fight for the working class , right trump voters ?
9218 0 here in washington , we voted to raise the minimum wage to $ 13.50 over the next three years , people will be able to buy more of the marijuana we legalized back in 2012 .
9219 1 i 'm sure wells fargo will pay for their crimes and actions under a trump administration .
9220 0 so maybe that 's why he only wants to be paid a dollar as president , garnished wages .
9221 1 too easily faked , as we can see with obummer
9222 0 they 're on to college certs now .
9223 0 he 's waiting so he can appoint them as federal judges .
9224 1 well , they would n't want to appoint a rapist .
9225 0 california is 1/6th of our country .
9226 1 well , california does have the economic output of a major country so that is possible ... except for all the socialist in california .
9227 0 say it with me folks , `` no shit sherlock '' .
9228 1 health care for the masses is secondary to assuring that the rich get even richer .
9229 0 i think that 'd be the furthest thing from patriotic .
9230 1 in other news , a trump spokeswoman says that surprising the dear leader with an offer of breakfast fellatio is patriotic .
9231 1 some hard-hitting investigative journalism .
9232 0 gosh , it 's like these `` news '' sites are n't really interested in reporting what goes on in the world so much as forwarding their own petty , vindictive agenda !
9233 0 they 'll never blame republicans , but it 's a form of scadenfreude
9234 1 fuck yeah , screw those blue collar jerks , it 's not like they vote amirite fellas ?
9235 0 to anyone with any even small connection to any african american community , this is like saying water is wet .
9236 1 all lives matter
9237 0 what a pathetic man .
9238 1 yep , that will all certainly offer so much help to the poor or lower middle class .
9239 0 when did the democrats start chasing white voters ?
9240 1 racial divisions , always a great strategy
9241 0 yea we probably have another one
9242 1 i suppose between morning ( when he tweeted about the drone ) and now trump got a note from bank of china about higher mortgage payments .
9243 1 what a populist !
9244 0 who the hell do these rich motherfuckers think will be able to buy their products if no one else has any money ?
9245 0 ahhh ceos are the anti christ ... making sure the business stays afloat to pay its employees .
9246 1 the market will take care of this !
9247 1 oh wow whatever shall we do !
9248 0 what a hero
9249 1 so with the 3 million illegal votes factored in , trump still won the popular vote !
9250 0 so then what did the russians hack or influence ?
9251 0 because trump supporters are consequentialists .
9252 1 45 % of those polled are republicans
9253 1 this was actually the result of chinese hackers , so it does n't count .. move along , nothing to see here .
9254 0 damned russian hackers !
9255 0 shut up and go away - i say this a democrat .
9256 1 how dare voters judge me by my actions !
9257 0 they are n't wrong .
9258 1 he does n't need to know how because he 's going to hire the best people !
9259 1 the russians did it .
9260 0 dems lost because they forced an uncharasmatic career politician on a group of voters that want nothing to do with the two party system .
9261 0 the opposite goes for democrats .
9262 1 because the other side played fair the entire election
9263 0 once again obama is on point .
9264 1 nah , it was jill stein 's fault
9265 1 hey now do n't come at nate cardboard like that , he admitted that he was super wrong and stuff jeez !
9266 0 i love how democrats turned on him for giving hillary anything less than a 99 % chance of victory .
9267 0 reddit is trusting polls now ?
9268 1 yea , because polls are trustworthy
9269 1 does everyone 's vote have the same weight in this poll or are 4 ny votes equal to one from wyoming ?
9270 0 eli5 = plurality of americans ...
9271 1 because everybody knows the republicans are all angels .
9272 0 could you point me to the e-mails posted on wikileaks , with direct links if you please , that exposes this presumably significant amount of corruption ?
9273 0 not being able to force normal people to humour your fetish does not equate to a crackdown on your rights .
9274 1 but trump had a rainbow flag , he 's totally pro lgbt
9275 1 well that 's useful .
9276 0 tag required : `` tabloid ''
9277 0 my party has a lot of wankers .
9278 1 that 's what happens when you teach that pro intellectually biased liberal curriculum
9279 1 so much small government
9280 0 and then they came for the porn , and that 's how the republicans lost all their `` white working class '' supporters .
9281 1 democrats need to bring their electors to heel .
9282 0 they should never have let hipsters be electors .
9283 1 obviously you do n't know that its america spirit that 's keeping him alive , similar to dick cheney ; he wants to maga to further strengthen the energy and gain immortality .
9284 0 that 's just in bad taste cmon man
9285 0 yes but you need to send jill stein cash money
9286 1 we need a money bomb for bernie right now , it aint over yet !
9287 1 what a shock

9292 0 this small government will fit nicely in trump 's hands .
9293 0 so you 're saying that partisanism is a partisan issue ?
9294 1 yeah , democrats always cross party lines .
9295 1 i 'm sure if it was reversed they would want to get rid of the ec
9296 0 the * '' integrity of the electoral process '' * was corrupted when states turned it into a rubber stamp instead of the stop-gap it was supposed to be .
9297 0 a little late there bud .

9312 1 i must say i am terribly shocked !
9313 1 so the real us leader was in the room , so ok
9314 0 when trump is president , he 'll be eating with the adults and all the crybaby dems can hang out at the kids table .
9315 1 but hey , at least we do n't have hillary in office .
9316 0 remember all the trump supporters screaming that trump was pro-lbgt and that he would be the better choice for the gay community because hillary once said she believed in traditional marriage like a decade+ ago ?
9317 0 is there anyone who is not completely full of shit ?
9318 1 lord knows obama would never want reagan to be upset
9319 1 relax none of us can be racist for like a month , we all have a black president .

9331 0 lol less than that if you count in the 4 faithless electors .

9351 1 yeah , aretha franklin singing at inauguration , how classless .
9352 0 yeah , it 'd be terrible to have someone in the white house who degrades women , would n't it ?
9353 0 once the camps are built , there will be plenty of jobs .
9354 1 yeah , but gay people are icky .
9355 1 good thing the trumplings did n't vote for the candidate that wanted war !

9359 0 we got ta make sure we can destroy all the insects too .
9360 1 you know , just in case putin reneges on that trump hotel in moscow .
9361 1 yeah , it really lends weight to the whole `` i voted for trump because hillary is a warmonger '' argument .
9362 0 i 'm sure it 's just an unbelievable coincidence that both trump and putin would announce a major policy change the same day .
9363 0 is putin trump 's new chief of staff ?
9364 1 putin defending trump , well that 's a surprise
9365 0 god have mercy on our souls

9367 1 we have heavily fortified bunkers , if you do n't than that 's your fault
9368 0 if it 's all fine then why the fuck do we need more nukes .
9369 1 but , her emails !
9370 0 cause she voted to give bush iraq war authorization that one time 13 years ago , der .
9371 0 it is remarkable how he continuously dissapoints me .
9372 1 but at least we stopped hillary from trying to negotiate a no-fly zone with russia , 'cause that totally would have caused ww3 !
9373 0 it 's like watching a really shitty movie somehow got a reboot , but with a director even shitter than the first one .
9374 1 because if there 's anything the bush administration excelled at , it was counterterrorism
9375 0 trump supporters are already further enabling the `` us vs them '' mentality by regurgitating his rhetoric .
9376 1 ruining the christmas present of a family member putting his name on a cause he does n't support , what could possibly go wrong ?
9377 1 because it 's going to all trickle down to the masses .

9379 1 nah , he 's super smart .
9380 0 of course not , he already did n't do his homework for the most difficult job interview in the world ( the debates )
9381 1 thought you knew that if obama did it , it was only ok if a goper did the exact same thing
9382 0 why is tiger woods doing this ?
9383 1 the libural thought police is at it again !
9384 0 looks like simple economic anxiety to me .
9385 0 the first hooker 's allowance must not be big enough .
9386 1 at least it isnt wasting money on trying to get kids to eat healthier
9387 0 horrendous

9393 1 when they go low we go lower
9394 0 i honestly had forgotten the tea party existed .
9395 0 i am sure the bernie or busters with student debts that were saying how trump is no different than clinton must be happy now .
9396 1 but there 's no difference between hillary and trump , so it 's ok .
9397 0 lets play the whose the most terrifying person in the incoming trump regime besides the orange monster himself .

9407 1 yes , let 's go back to the gilded age where teenagers worked in factories for pennies an hour !
9408 0 i know , for the work you do .
9409 1 just remember since labor is 100 % of the costs of a product the cost of a good will increase yugely !
9410 0 unfortunately rents will also likely go up or staff hours will be cut making the wage increase ineffective and useless .
9411 1 but he appeared on tv because he 's wildly successful , not because he needed the money
9412 0 he does want nukes
9413 0 how is this news ?
9414 1 well there 's a surprise .
9415 0 this is the 5th thread with exact same title .
9416 1 for some people maybe that signals reaching across the aisle
9417 0 man , does this guy always look like this , or did they manage to snap the most evil looking shot they could of him ?
9418 1 with all the threats that trump makes , should n't this just be viewed as a stand your ground case ?
9419 0 should wilbur ross be working for the benefit of the british people ?
9420 1 you mean brexit was n't a good idea in the long or short run ?
9421 1 cnn telling you what to do and think ... definitely not fake news

9435 0 `` if you think hiroshima was good , just wait until you see what trump has planned . ''

9449 0 only because they do n't have enough guns , apparently , according to the theory of more guns equals more safety
9450 1 nice to see such a reliable source .
9451 0 # lugenpresse do n't be fooled fellow centipedes i swear there are so many unfunny similarities with how fascist parties come to power it 's unreal

10166 0 a soft pussy grab
10167 1 if you think this is something , wait till i tell you about the emails .
10168 0 ah yes but that non-report about irrelevant emails was the one that had to get publicized right before the election to avoid looking partisan ...
10169 0 sounds about right , trump realises there is benefit to being jingoistic but seems to generally think people who take part in protests or fight as part of the armed forces are 'dummies '
10170 1 trump 's greatest sacrifice for america : he dodged the draft 5 times .
10171 0 -scoff-
10172 1 human rights list is just another arm of the crooked evil msmbcnnine11 ...
10173 0 redstate upset that nobody knows who redstate is .

10175 0 `` horrible shape '' to trump = lots of blacks .
10176 1 yeah , but it will be when donald is finished with it and then he will go `` seeee folks ... i told you it was horrible , shameful , the worst shape ''
10177 1 he was just wishing him well five times over the course of the day
10178 0 treason .
10179 1 who is michael dukakis ?
10180 0 the only one that needs to apologize is hillary .
10181 0 fuck the gop
10182 1 but it means more jobs and money for the rest of us via trickle down .
10183 0 obvious attempt at damage control .
10184 1 wow look at that guys and you all were calling him a racist !
10185 0 yeah , but who has more pickup trucks ?
10186 1 makes sense that they 're going to need so many buses when none of the backs will be full
10187 0 shocking .. the voice of the neo-nazis ( alt-right ) aligns with trump over a civil rights leader .
10188 1 breaking : in unprecedented move breitbart says trump was right
10189 1 i 've always said that the most genuine opinion any reporter can obtain from anyone is from a lobbyist while you 're buying him lunch .
10190 0 well we 're set to find out
10191 0 subtle !
10192 1 nothing suspicious here , nope , no way .
10193 0 unpopular but ironically he is one of the most powerful in modern history , sad
10194 1 fake news !
10195 1 $ 1000 fine for someone on food stamps seems perfectly reasonable .
10196 0 for being so `` small government `` gop lawmakers sure seem to love telling poor people how to live
10197 0 can we pin these job losses on trump ?
10198 1 see trump has already made 22 people lose their jobs and he is n't even in office yet .
10199 0 - abandon all hope ye who enter here
10200 1 boy , trump is really getting ready to put us on the right track , huh ?
10201 1 of course not , because there are black people there
10202 0 he would burst into flames upon entering anyway .
10203 1 of course it 's outrageous , his kind used to be payed much more back in those days
10204 0 yea go ahead and attack the cia , that wo n't end badly ... lol .
10205 1 i for one welcome our new russian overlords .
10206 0 i feel like russia is minuscule in terms of things trump `` does n't understand '' .
10207 1 do n't worry , they are only repealing obamacare not the aca
10208 0 letting media ownership get consolidated into a handful of multinational mega-corps will be seen , by history , as largely a bad move .
10209 1 talks or new instructions ?
10210 0 trump 's not doing anything to put those puppet allegations to rest .
10211 0 i 'm surprised that no one seems to question why a future senior official of the government call the ambassador of another country to schedule a phone call for a future date ?
10212 1 yes -- all five of them
10213 1 this is in * no way * related to how he 's putin 's lackey and is staffing his cabinet with similar putin lackeys .
10214 0 `` communicate directly with his followers '' followers ... cults have followers
10215 1 oh you mean `` anyone part of the liberal establishment want to chime in ? ''
10216 0 he 's an idiot .
10217 1 to be fair , then we 'd be even for saving them in ww2 .
10218 0 i do n't think any one country can save us , i think it would have to be combined effort of the intelligence agencies of the west .
10219 0 more like pants on fire false , but ok ?
10220 1 he 's black so it 's obviously obvious that his district is falling apart and crime infested .
10221 1 it 's not the aca that is being repealed , it 's obamacare !
10222 0 so , these people like their plans and want to keep it , huh ?
10223 1 his twitter account ?
10224 0 this is the best example of fake news i 've seen so far domestically .
10225 0 way to state the obvious .
10226 1 good thing trump is going to bring back all those low education high paying jobs .
10227 1 we 're going to get everything and pay nothing
10228 0 i.e - the same shark tank situation that existed before the aca - except maybe they 'll outlaw states from being able to regulate shady practices ( like happened here in ny state pre-obamacare ) and make things even more cut-throat and awful .
10229 1 thanks , obama .
10230 0 i have a feeling it 's more likely that this congressman is the racist pig here .
10231 1 does n't he have a place in the new administration yet ?
10232 0 let me guess : james o'keefe exposes a group plotting criminal activity at trump 's inauguration , and that group is being led by ... james o'keefe !
10233 0 /thundering applause
10234 1 i am waiting for president-elect trump to tweet that he has the best magicians performing since he has been told that everyone is disappearing .
10235 1 everyone knows these polls are not how the public really feels .
10236 0 trump knows that his tax returns are a key part to what will eventually be his downfall .
10237 1 oh , well that makes it ok then .
10238 0 i always tell liberals the best thing about having a republican in charge is the press cares about things like this .
10239 1 that 's just smart business .
10240 0 what a surprise
10241 1 it 'll trickle down .
10242 0 no mention of rothschilds ?
10243 0 ah yes the gop taking trump 's words to heart , `` grab her by the pussy . ''
10244 1 typical mac user thinking he 's so special .
10245 0 glorious 115 % approval ratings !
10246 1 yeah , just add this to the list of all his other broken campaign promises he did n't even bother to fulfill .
10247 0 brought to you by the same people who told us hillary had a 98 % chance of winning .
10248 1 not bad for a gay kenyan dictator pussy muslim who supports isis
10249 0 74 % of people are journalists .
10250 1 til 74 % of americans are reporters .
10251 1 but he knows it when he sees it !
10252 0 tl ; dr : black america is doing just fine and does n't need any help from trump .
10253 1 it 's totally not coming from the russians
10254 0 did they forget pissgate against trump ?
10255 1 still , he does n't get it , he 's white .
10256 0 so ?
10257 1 yes , that 's why obama failed .
10258 0 fake news
10259 0 the final vote count was in the margin of error for the polling so the polls were n't inaccurate , you can blame specific pundits and analysts for being too generous with clinton 's odds , but the numbers were less than a percent off the final result also a lack of polling in certain states
10260 1 he would have polled better if cnn had n't included millions of illegal immigrants .
10261 1 lol thats not true at all & amp ; those site are full of rigged fake news
10262 0 this is the same poll that said hillary would win right ?
10263 0 which side makes them money ?
10264 1 shh , do n't you know , they 're both the same !
10265 1 ca n't have these pesky externalities interfering with growth !
10266 0 more of those darn `` job killing regulations '' .
10267 1 i 'm shocked that more people are n't excited about our president being a reality television star who has never paid taxes or held any form of office .
10268 0 is this different than the ones that have been posted every day since the election ?
10269 1 sounds very free market to me .
10270 0 gop is all about free market ..... so long g as the freemarket is one of the existing corporations that have contributed to the party .
10271 1 gr * eeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaa * t .
10272 0 yeah , because god created a variety of different niche species so man could kill 'em because fuck yeah !
10273 1 but both sides are the same and hillary would have been so terrible
10274 0 i do n't get it , when did republicans become so anti privacy ?
10275 0 better do it within three days jules
10276 1 i trust his honor .
10277 0 just the typical american hyperbole .
10278 1 you racist !
10279 0 yes reminds me of the time whenever anyone would go against clinton and dws called up their boss to get them fired
10280 1 it is n't fascism until the camps start .
10281 1 we need a puerto rican registry !
10282 0 he also says the voices in his head told him to join isis .
10283 1 trump tied to people who are rasist waat no way
10284 0 aw hell , just about anywhere in alabama yawl can find white guys who 'll do that fer free .
10285 0 is this maga in action ?
10286 1 or as she calls it , freeing those kids from repressive regulations so they can reach their full potential without shackles .
10287 1 finally , we will be free from the obama care oppression .
10288 0 how much have premiums increased since the aca ?
10289 1 just like russia and north korea wonderful
10290 0 well doesnt * this * reek of nazi germany
10291 0 and north korea !
10292 1 please , i can only get so hard .
10293 0 because otherwise the crowds would be laughably tiny .
10294 1 what a great use of taxpayer 's money !
10295 1 but its cold right now
10296 0 the temperature record , and thermometers , is a hoax from china .
10297 0 oooh , while we are at it can we replace lethal injection with drawing and quartering ?
10298 1 if you ca n't afford healthcare , you ca n't afford to donate to trump , therefore you are irrelevant .
10299 0 he tweeted the following : `` if mcdonalds brings back the chicken fajita and the mcrib , i 'll definitely turn myself over . ''
10300 1 i am shocked .
10301 0 they should diversify to make li batteries .. then electric cars will boom ... then they can go back to installing brake cables .
10302 1 i think we can all agree this is fake news .
10303 0 obama should resign today making joe biden the 45th potus just to ruin all of trump 's inauguration merchandise .
10304 1 watergate was a hotel , right ?
10305 1 yes becuase trump needs money
10306 0 trump is a clinton plant , guys .
10307 1 ca n't let your guard down , he still has 2 more days to take all our guns and lock us up in fema camps .
10308 0 and all of those people will just claim none of it happened because of their vigilance .
10309 0 9 states legalized it while he was president , and he let them .
10310 1 you can not expect the first half-white president to accomplish such a daunting task , only full-white bureaucrats can summon the power to stand up against the smear campaigns of big pharma and big tobacco who will try to slander and stop them .
10311 0 is anyone surprised ?
10312 1 pink news is so reliable .
10313 0 trump would privatize the military if it made him a buck
10314 1 i 'm sure this can only end in good things and not the wanton murder of innocents .
10315 1 i 'm sure trump will now give up his presidency because of this
10316 0 he equates chickens with food which vegetarians do not .
10317 0 no conflict , no conflict , you 're the conflict !
10318 1 nah , it will be fine because he 's playing 12d parcheesi .
10319 1 how dare he mooch off obama .
10320 0 who wants to bet they 're white guys
10321 1 that 's like me not finding some change in between the couch cushions , come on give the guy a break
10322 0 the guy is such a beaver fucking an ass pimple that he has no reason to be our treasury secretary .
10323 1 right , but taxing imports from certain countries wo n't .
10324 0 you already pay extra on april 15th every year because the minimum wage is low .
10325 0 what self respecting hispanic would serve with him anyway ?
10326 1 maybe because they do n't look the part .
10327 1 i 've looked into the future , it 's the liberals fault .
10328 0 they will blame democrats
10329 0 wow , this will surely go over well .
10330 1 i 'm sure they 'll welcome him with open arms after 6 months of him trash talking them .
10331 0 why do republicans hate anything remotely intellectual or democratic ?
10332 1 yeah , look at privatization of tlc or rather , federal prison system and see how well it turned out .
10333 0 no , trump will allow good art - portraits of him , portraits of cowboys and soldiers , portraits of battle scenes - maybe even that art of the dallas cowboys as cowboys .
10334 1 oh , and i 'm sure he 'll leave the gun-owners alone , because a well armed populace is exactly what a dictator wants .
10335 0 my cousin has a phd in english literature , works for google , and has a million pound flat in london .
10336 1 all those idiots from princeton university that got history degrees and social science degrees that are now working in finance ... yeah , totally pointless .
10337 1 maybe china will stop protecting them
10338 0 hopefully they test it by launching it up his ass .
10339 1 well , no one can doubt his experience in the drug trade !
10340 0 i do n't know whether to upvote because it 's fucking hilarious , or downvote because of the rule-breaking title .
10341 1 very professional of him .
10342 0 i wonder if springsteen played born in the usa .
10343 0 does this guy also happen to own cnn ?
10344 1 gee , did n't see that coming at all .
10345 1 no they should be forced to watch , `` clockwork orange '' style .
10346 0 self censoring like this is just ignorant .
10347 1 yeah , because the democratic party is such a bastion of intellectualism .
10348 0 this leftist meltdown might be one of the greatest things i 've ever seen , and i 'm not even a trump fan .
10349 0 i 'd like to believe this guy 100 % , but something tells me we are missing a few relevant facts .
10350 1 damn it obama
10351 1 electing a shitty human being to be president , this is going to end well
10352 0 there are at least a 99 problems that are more relevant than the sexual assault ( for him being pres , not for him being a free roaming human ) .
10353 0 how can.he have an approval rating before he does anything
10354 1 well , obviously it must be a fake poll result if it 's from fox news ...
10355 1 if obamacare is more popular than trump , imagine the gap between trump and the affordable care act
10356 0 the `` affordable '' care act is a joke
10357 1 this is n't fake fucking news or anything .
10358 0 money well spent apparently
10359 0 well that did n't take long .
10360 1 i 'm sure julian assange will have all the information up on wikileaks immediately .
10361 0 thank you , london !
10362 1 dig a moat not build a wall ?
10363 0 putin is laughing his ass off with all the protest going on .
10364 1 because not being enemies with russia would be the worst foreign policy decision ever .
10365 1 great job of uniting the country , donald
10366 0 the actual headline is : `` donald trump protests : limo 'set on fire ' and 217 arrested as police use tear gas on black-clad activists ''
10367 0 well , if they 'd just die -- the gop 's hopes for america would be just so much easier .
10368 1 since everything else has failed to motivate these people maybe this will drive them to get good jobs so they can buy their own insurance .
10369 0 and yet not one of you cared about the clinton foundation taking in foreign money ?
10370 1 it 's okay , because in his heart he did n't violate it
10371 1 well all his cabinet nominations scream `` helping the little guy '' so far
10372 0 so he wont trample on the values of the majority .
10373 1 so he is honoring the majority of the peoples choice and stepping down ?
10374 0 translation : we 're going to make the government weak and allow it to be privatized to the hilt with the guise of giving power back to the people because businesses are people .
10375 0 russia is trumps america .
10376 1 which is clearly a good thing
10377 1 well , if he has nothing to hide , he has nothing to fear , right ?
10378 0 aww , not enough safe spaces for you ?
10379 0 pure fucking darkness .
10380 1 what climate change webpage ?
10381 0 wonder who 's words he 's going to plagiarize ?
10382 1 we 're saved !
10383 1 right , better to just pick a better school than to put time and money into making them all better ... nothing bad will come of that .
10384 0 claiming that this is a fight for school choice is inaccurate .
10385 0 next h -- - jail i m confuse now : p
10386 1 see ... he has already eliminated climate change !
10387 1 very unfair !
10388 0 95k already , this should be at 100k in a few hours .
10389 1 fake news !
10390 0 i put everyone to work so fast , they could n't take off to be at my inauguration .
10391 1 renters are always victims .
10392 0 * slumlord
10393 1 at least he does n't have ties to putin
10394 0 fuck nigel farage and everything about him .
10395 0 no comrade , you are getting the facts confused again .
10396 1 which is why he won the democratic primary , naturally .
10397 1 so are we just gon na let him get away with that ?
10398 0 it 's the first executive tweet !
10399 1 but but trump supporters had to work that 's why they were n't there
10400 0 will this finally be what stumps the trump ?
10401 1 if he was a real man he would grab her pussy and piss on her face .
10402 0 michelle 's disgusted look was worth the click .
10403 0 this will not be a popular position to take
10404 1 what 's the point of being a fascist if you do n't have a secret police force ?
10405 0 naww , did n't make it to become uks ambassador but uncle murdoch gave him a little job , how nice .
10406 1 so they 're giving american jobs to foreigners at fox ?
10407 0 really tired of seeing `` could '' in these news articles .
10408 1 this should work out well .
10409 1 it 's nice to see 100,000 reporters coming together .
10410 0 wah wah wah
10411 0 even if he did want medicare for all it would be a miracle for congress to pass that .
10412 1 riiiiiigggghhhhhtttttt
10413 0 to take the filters off , this makes it hard for someone who ca n't afford a $ 250k home from buying a $ 250k home .
10414 1 thanks donald !
10415 1 only white people have families , blacks just have illegitimate kids .
10416 0 but family matters was about a black family .
10417 1 and george soros paid each of these protesters 3,000 bucks !
10418 0 proud to be there !
10419 1 but obama was the censorship dictator !

10423 1 see , cnn definitely has a liberal bias , just like trump said , they are just out to get him .
10424 0 i 'm waiting for the breitbart headline that says `` 500,000 women on their periods and their libcuck boyfriends unleash socialist tirade on washington '' .
10425 0 all roar no bite , at least where it counts , at the voting booth .
10426 1 i 'll wait for trumps press secretary to tell me how many people were there thank you very much
10427 1 c'mon , they would n't do that .
10428 0 they already said they were going ( to try ) to pick the correspondents to be allowed in the wh press corps .
10429 1 but why would the ~~ministry of truth~~ press secretary lie ?
10430 0 crybaby
10431 0 i do n't recognize the source - is there a track record of legitimate reporting ?
10432 1 but marine le pen said russia is our friend and they are fantastic and putin is god

10443 1 state media yayyy

10445 0 we are not going to stop asking for it though buckle up buckaroo .
10446 1 because transparency is for losers .
10447 0 how about you go back to australia , nicky .

10452 0 i know deep down spicer is a patriot he knows he 's serving a very wrong administration .
10453 1 i 'm sure madonna is a credible threat .
10454 0 hate trump or not , threatening to blow up the white house is a threat of terrorism , and does nothing to resolve issues in our country .
10455 0 so is this good for weed ?
10456 1 well in his defense there is no real proof other than facts and data .
10457 0 if i type allahu akbar will they write an article about me ?

10462 1 ... on the bright side that bitch meryl streep will know to keep her mouth shut
10463 0 this could realistically start an actual jihad against the us .
10464 1 no no this definitely wo n't cause a fucking world war
10465 1 way to get taken for a ride by known liberal hacks pew research guys !
10466 0 it 's hard to give a shit about numbers like these when 40+ percent of the country did n't vote .

10478 0 why are experts needed to verify this , i 'm sure any 12 yr old with vision could call this out
10479 0 eh , even being pro-choice i 'm not sure if it 's a good use of money to fund international abortions .
10480 1 both sides are the same !
10481 0 ask the payroll department for where i work , they definitely know the answer !
10482 1 they 're just trying to put money back in americans ' pockets by slashing the federal government 's enormous voicemail bill
10483 0 ernie will have a great time with this i hate my state government
10484 1 no point of being politically correct in trump alt-reality !
10485 1 totally no difference between the parties !
10486 0 aaand the regression of what was accomplished the past 8 years officially begins !
10487 0 you ca n't tax or draft an aborted person .
10488 1 there has to be some form of punishment .
10489 1 at what point does the pentagon just coup .
10490 0 that 's a war crime .
10491 1 `` you all know that the 3rd saturday in january is protest day , right ? ''

10496 1 hey guys do n't worry , he 's not wrong , he 's just using alternative facts !
10497 0 he must have wished him a very , very , very , very very merry christmas
10498 1 how many times a day do you thank a guy for helping you win the election ?
10499 0 donnie , you really need to stop posting on reddit and get around to the business of governing .
10500 1 yes , they should capitulate and give trump everything with no resistance that will make democrats happy as the country goes to hell .
10501 0 lock him up .
10502 1 but ... but ... e-mails !
10503 1 i am sure his plans are nuanced and well-thought out .
10504 0 too late , already a done deal
10505 0 trump doesnt care .
10506 1 `` it 's because his policies are n't conservative enough ''
10507 1 well is certainly helping our farmers/agricultural industry out .
10508 0 trump needs to go , by force if necessary .
10509 1 oh good , next time conservatives will get to gripe about actual economic anxiety .
10510 0 republicans seem to excel at bringing about recessions .
10511 1 yes , it 's all about him .
10512 0 wow , what a despicable egomaniac piece of shit to say something like that !
10513 0 list the technologies , products and services that are sole creations by china that will make it dominant .
10514 1 wtf i love the tpp now
10515 1 the coal folks in those swing states must be so excited that all of this oil will be flowing into the us
10516 0 say goodbye to clean water and air .
10517 0 he does n't really want the job and he trying to do what he can to get out .
10518 1 well if there was widespread voter fraud , he should step down and demand that the election be held again , this time with safeguards in place to keep illegal immigrants from voting , which as everyone knows is why they come to america and certainly not for a job .
10519 1 the keystone pipeline will go right over nebraska 's drinking water supply , but i am sure canadian oil is more important than drinking water .
10520 0 i believe a dictator is setting up and history is going to repeat itself : (
10521 0 `` so let 's cut taxes further '' said the least intelligent people .
10522 1 man , that debt ceiling fight is gon na be rough .
10523 1 literally destroying democracy
10524 0 booya !
10525 0 so be it if dapl goes forward .
10526 1 both sides are exactly the same amirite ?
10527 0 reporters should hang a picture of the crowd from the back to counter .
10528 1 might as well hang a picture of his penis , enlarged and from a certain perspective to show how yuge it is .
10529 1 yea , but that 's only because people who illegally voted were polled .
10530 0 also sets new low point for basic decency .
10531 1 yea , but those millions were illegal voters so they do n't have a say in the matter
10532 0 does n't that make him delusional ?
10533 0 `` right now the focus is putting americans back to work '' amid lowest-unemployment numbers in years .
10534 1 man , if elections are so fraudulent , we should just stop having them .
10535 1 thanks obummer .
10536 0 america !

10539 0 thanks stein voters .
10540 1 both parties are the same !
10541 1 this is very surprising to me .
10542 0 this is from august of last year , why post it now ?
10543 0 i expect all those conservatives who are outraged about executive orders to get really pissed now , lol .
10544 1 he * really * has the best interest of the people in mind .
10545 1 hmm , glad to have this stunning insight from rush limbaugh 's myspace page .
10546 0 one can not steal that which is freely given .
10547 0 what do we do with incivil source material ?
10548 1 seriously , let 's all treat rush limbaugh 's xanga page as a legitimate news source .
10549 1 they were n't from lifezette or breitbart so they obviously were n't really journalists .
10550 0 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government , and to provide new guards for their future security .
10551 0 this is really interesting , given the fact that the narrative of obama being trigger happy when it came to executive orders circulated through even liberal circles .
10552 1 but he 's black so one executive order equals 3 or 5 !
10553 0 donald did say he was interested in going to mars , did n't he ?
10554 1 so you 're saying it 's possible .
10555 0 good .
10556 1 i bet all of the agriculture republicans will be delighted at this .
10557 1 tax dollars well spent
10558 0 tomorrow , a lot of americans ( myself included ) will be very , very pissed off .
10559 1 finally , those fema camps that conservative 's swore obama was going to use to round them up are going to be put to good use .
10560 0 give me an f give me an a give me an s give me an c give me an i give me an s give me an t what 's that spell ?
10561 1 ok and 97 % of scientists agree on global warming , so what ?
10562 0 two thirds of americans disagree with drumpf
10563 1 what a wonderful use of tax money
10564 0 but even if they do n't find voter fraud we ca n't trust him to tell the truth , a narcissist is not going to admit he is wrong .
10565 1 this is obviously the best way to cut down on wastage in government .
10566 0 this is getting so fucking ridiculous .
10567 1 gee , i sure do love my state !
10568 0 resist their laws mean nothing anymore
10569 0 that should tell americans something .
10570 1 if only trump had complete state media control like they do in russia !
10571 1 oh no , madonna is done now
10572 0 if she were a republican making comments like that she 'd be in trump 's cabinet by now .
10573 0 sounds like they want to make sure that their big oil and gas buddies interests are not impeded .
10574 1 exactly the sort of thing the president should be micromanaging .
10575 1 well bannon is not an illegal so i guess it 's ok
10576 0 he just has an alternative state of residence .
10577 1 yeah , but he could n't push it over the arbitrary 20k mark - that was all trump .
10578 0 clearly we needed to put an end to this lunacy .
10579 1 well ... he needs some place to put the journalists .
10580 0 enhanced sites with alternative interrogation techniques .
10581 0 it is so weird how speculation is now considered news .
10582 1 make america rendition again !
10583 1 it 's reassuring to know that it 's actually bill o'reilly that 's shaping policy !
10584 0 i hope he makes a law recognizing that hosts are sentient beings and have feelings too .
10585 0 what would they know !
10586 1 apparently there 's plenty of alternate evidence
10587 0 so why was obama forced to use some hacked up blackberry and this guy gets to do what he wants ?
10588 1 well , it 's not like he has a private email server or anything
10589 1 wow , i for one am thoroughly shocked
10590 0 lol
10591 1 he is probably hard at work setting up a new 'classy walls , llc ' company under baron 's name to award contracts to .
10592 0 oh yeah you know he has buddies that will benefit .
10593 0 history books will cite this as one reason for the 2nd american civil war , the conservatives willful rejection of consensual reality .
10594 1 both sides are the same !
10595 0 hahahaha
10596 1 mmw , this is the beginning of the end for trump !
10597 0 they 're not fake truths , theyre alternative facts .
10598 1 alternative truths !
10599 1 he 's such a great businessman though !
10600 0 loser
10601 0 obvious self-promoted trump circle jerk is obvious .
10602 1 ah yes because everyone knows starting off your research with a clear bias is reasonable .
10603 1 damn politics content is really getting better .
10604 0 seriously , with all the thing wrong you worry about this shit , wtf is wrong with you people , get a fucking life and worry about things that actually matter
10605 1 we need to make sure that the science is alternative science .
10606 0 wonder how trump supporters will defend this
10607 0 how about `` trump first , then you other fucks can have the scraps .
10608 1 i bet if you drilled down into the meaning or implications of those vacuous words , you 'd find a lot of agreement .
10609 1 hillary and trump are totally the same .
10610 0 this white house leaks more than a russian hooker in a trump-rented hotel room .
10611 0 maybe we could auction these off to pay for the big beautiful fence extension .
10612 1 it 's hard for me to believe that , after getting what he wanted , the con man is n't following through with his promises .
10613 0 he 's gon na build a fire wall
10614 1 that 's not concerning at all
10615 1 noooo but the emailsssss
10616 0 it 's not a turn a turn implies they were on a different path .
10617 0 another nail in our coffin
10618 1 whoo
10619 1 they will need to finish the audit of it first .
10620 0 prediction : chaffetz will actually do his job when it comes to republicans immediately before turning himself in for his classified private email server .
10621 1 is this what they mean by peer-review ?
10622 0 i feel like darth sidious has been put in charge of the jedi order .
10623 1 but alternative facts say that illegal border crossing is at an all-time high !
10624 0 if it 's undocumented , how do you quantify it for a stat ?
10625 1 the fact that i feel economic anxiety and blindly blame mexicans and you wo n't just let me do that without mocking my paranoia is why trump won !
10626 0 for a group that harps constantly about hard work and self-sufficiency , they sure are a needy bunch .
10627 1 it was easy , they were all counted when they registered to vote for hillary clinton in the states she needed it the least
10628 0 lol , was thinking the same .
10629 1 the wall just got 10 feet higher
10630 0 i do n't know what else to say but 'no shit sherlock '
10631 0 most likely never .
10632 1 he 's constructing a wall
10633 1 but , the time for unity is now .
10634 0 david muir 's look of incredulity in the article photo , staring in astonishment as trump blathers on , is priceless .
10635 0 tell me more about how trump changed the doomsday clock
10636 1 trump has a lot of leverage given the 43 % unemployment rate .
10637 0 it 's telling when the _donald trashbuckets avoid threads like these .
10638 1 yeah , but he 's a brown republican so who cares .
10639 0 yo i heard trump was born in kenya .
10640 1 because trump did n't try to do that with obama and the birth certificate issue .
10641 0 at this point , i wo n't rule anything out .
10642 1 come on now , hillary lost , there 's no reason to keep insulting her .
10643 1 well , at least he is president
10644 0 i dont understand , why is there so many people upset when he won fair and square the elections ?
10645 0 impeach the mother fucker already
10646 1 george soros must have paid him to cancel .
10647 0 if we are to accept the idea that the slogan is a racist dog whistle , meaning make america how it was in the 50s again before social liberalism began to take hold , then we can conclude the cutting ties with brown people will in fact make america great again .
10648 1 it 'll stop white genocide
10649 1 i 'm sure new hampshire and vermont must be a blood bath due to having the most lax gun laws in the country .
10650 0 lol good one bruh
10651 0 and in related news , captain queeg proves beyond the shadow of a doubt and with ... geometric logic ... that a duplicate key to the wardroom icebox did exist , and that he would have produced that key if they had n't of pulled the caine out of action .
10652 1 what a good use of taxpayer money .
10653 0 period .
10654 1 nah , this will be one of them fake.polls the media has made up to somehow try and make him look bad .
10655 0 no one is saying that the government should punch nazis .
10656 1 yes if someone dare disagrees with your beliefs surely the honorable thing to do is punch them in the face .
10657 1 that oughta really help the us businessman .
10658 0 i 'm not sure how raising the cost of a third of our products by 23 percent ( after handling charges ) will benefit americans .
10659 1 i 'm sure this wo n't affect prices of anything trump supporters buy .
10660 0 looks like we , the american people , will be paying for the wall after all !
10661 1 what need are their for petitions when we can have such great interactions with the tweeter in chief via twitter ?
10662 0 i can hear him saying , `` just until we have figured out what 's going on ! ''
10663 0 so purity test ?
10664 1 but he 's nice though !
10665 0 we are not north korea .
10666 1 but hillary is the warhawk !

10681 0 guess which former , recent president lived there ?
10682 1 he 's mad about the cubs winning .
10683 0 trump has the most pathetic fragile ego .. i bet he threw a few temper tantrums when he realized obama was way more popular than he will ever be .
10684 1 see guys theres irrefutable proof : in this picture you can clearly see 2 million to 9 billion people in that crowd .
10685 0 i thought kim jung un was the sole source of truth .
10686 1 that does n't sound shady at all .
10687 1 i 'm * shocked * lem me tell you
10688 0 their silence is very loud
10689 0 what motherfuckers .
10690 1 definitely not a puppet .
10691 1 what a hero .
10692 0 while i do n't agree with the action , why would it be acceptable to put your hands on anyone for practicing their guaranteed rights granted by the constitution ?
10693 1 rigged polls clearly
10694 0 i 've always felt that more people than would admit , when it comes down to it , actually support it , but are afraid to speak out because of the false equivalency of `` it 's murder '' .
10695 0 just rename planned parenthood to the center for the blessed mother .
10696 1 in front of a remarkably tiny crowd he claimed they were winning .
10697 1 thank god , i was so worried about our military not being strong enough .
10698 0 ca n't wait to see what the us debt looks like after more defense spending , a giant wall , obamacare being repealed ( but insurance for all ) , tax cuts and infrastructure .
10699 0 jesus would be rejected because he was a jew .
10700 1 thank god
10701 1 he did it because jews were n't the only ones involved in the holocaust , he 's a president for all , guys
10702 0 you 're lucky he did n't blame the jews for provoking the nazis
10703 1 there 's an easy fix for addressing these problems - repeal the clean air and clean water acts .
10704 0 iowa farmers reap what they sow
10705 1 sooo , like 5 people ?
10706 0 exactly what america was founded on : religious discrimination .
10707 1 i 'm sure the us military in those countries wo n't have any problems recruiting translators and guides there after this .
10708 0 i did see somewhere that there was a special provision in it that left the door open for exceptions on a case by case basis , presumably for people like this .
10709 1 i 'm sure it was those filthy clintons again .
10710 0 read the headline as `` trump dead '' thought everything was good
10711 0 how many people are killed by a lack of affordable healthcare in the united states ?
10712 1 yes , but obama was going to bring 360 billion refugees so your chances of being killed would be 100 killeds .
10713 1 lock him up !
10714 0 damn , that 's nearly 22 days of aid to israel , better stop that shit right now
10715 1 i 'm sure they will follow the scripture and apply john 3:16 alone during the vetting process .
10716 0 thank god the founders of this country said its freedoms only applied to christians ... ca n't have anyone else seek refuge in the `` free world . ''
10717 0 any idiot who does n't think we should bring in refugees because they might be terrorists should ask themselves one simple question : if you wanted to go to another country and kill a bunch of people , why would you choose the slowest possible method of getting there ?
10718 1 new tactic is n't a threat because it has n't been used before .
10719 0 lol hello fake news
10720 1 huh , treating people with respect makes them not hate you , who woulda thought ?
10721 0 maybe google should hire americans then .
10722 1 more jobs for real americans

10724 1 trump making america a safer place as he promised .
10725 1 yeah , worked out great for tony blair ...
10726 0 maybe she is also afraid of ukip .
10727 1 lol yes i can really see how a physical barrier between usa and mexico serves the israeli best interest
10728 0 if netanyahu praises something you are doing you should probably take a long hard look at the consequences of your actions .
10729 0 no , just no !
10730 1 surely this will make the united states more safe .
10731 1 the mark of a person who is clearly not petty and just wants what 's best for everyone

10736 1 and he will resign when his plan fails
10737 1 haha take that liberals !

10740 0 trump is already saving usa money by letting other countries take the cost .
10741 1 it is n't `` jews lives matter '' its `` all lives matter ''

10756 1 trump is doing great i see !
10757 1 move on , nothing to see here .

10760 1 that sounds like fascism though , surely we 'd never elect a fascist !
10761 0 ya think ?
10762 1 next thing you know isis will want to do us some harm and maybe even hurt some people .
10763 0 when even boris johnson says you 're going too far .

10780 0 the beauty of checks and balances !
10781 1 yeah but those 51 % are all illegal immigrants voting .
10782 0 is it really all that surprising given how many people disapproved of him before he became president ?

10784 1 might as well not try then , right ?
10785 0 alcoholic moron usurps military .
10786 1 bannon is just maga , after all as trump 's brain he must also know more than generals .

10788 0 i have n't been this proud of my state senators for some time .
10789 1 but i thought he knew more than the generals .

10795 0 america is reaping the fruits of republican party in complete control ... that 's what it is doing .
10796 1 oh just give him a chance
10797 1 while the rise was all due to trump , i 'm sure that the drop has to be obama 's fault .
10798 0 trump rally is at its end with the realization of the trump reality .

11268 1 but no one is trying to take your guns !

11278 1 dat makes him smart
11279 0 `` if you like your doctor you can keep him '' ?

11293 0 lyin ' ted ?
11294 1 wonder who 's going to come out on top in that ?
11295 0 not a trump supporter , but i imagine they will say that it 's not corrupt ; the democrats are being crybabies and are trying to undermine trump 's administration , so this is the only way to get around it
11296 1 y'all started it
11297 1 this is what democracy looks like
11298 0 based on what i saw from nancy pelosi 's town hall last night , we are on our own .
11299 1 but remember guys , both parties are exactly the same !
11300 0 this is what happens when you puss off the majority of the voting population and therefore lose the majority of your power .
11301 0 would their twitter accounts fall under foia ?
11302 1 that seems like a secure way to communicate .
11303 0 aaannnnd his dementia has taken us back to the 1980s apparently .
11304 1 this has nothing to do with bannon 's idea that the `` judeo-christian west '' needs to fight a global cultural war and that there are too many asian techies in silicon valley .
11305 0 it wouldnt surprise me if putin put trump in office just to have a president be docile towards him while he conquers .
11306 1 the only rational response is to drop all sanctions against russia
11307 0 if by `` overhaul '' you mean `` dismantle . ''
11308 1 this will , clearly , end well .
11309 0 that 's like saying good on ( random person ) for de-armenianing the armenian genocide .
11310 1 i 'm glad they 're showing so much concern for the socialists , communists , roma , and homosexuals who were also killed .
11311 0 watch the exxon stock explode in the next months .
11312 1 now this is what i call draining the swamp !
11313 0 please , god , let this be the last we hear of him .
11314 1 oh my gosh he 's leaving to oversee the gas chambers for the undesirables !
11315 1 look at what he has done for alabama .
11316 0 `` is a good and decent man '' ... sounds like something you say about someone that is facing criminal charges
11317 0 yup , seems like the greatest job creator god ever created has been more preoccupied with firing everyone in sight .
11318 1 but they can all go get jobs at new clean coal plants so it 's fine .
11319 0 this ca n't possibly have anything to do with our new sos being the recent ceo of a major drilling company , can it ?
11320 1 more swamp draining !
11321 0 if trump and his cronies have their way , the national debt will most likely balloon .

11326 1 her voice reminded me of my mother in law and i 'm sure other country 's leaders would agree !
11327 0 sure , minority president donald , poke the bear why do n't you .
11328 1 i 'm sure trump would be just as upset if bill maher or arianna huffington was n't allowed to speak at berkeley and he 'd do the same thing he 's doing now .
11329 1 b ... b .. but hilary and benghazi !
11330 0 trump wanted a bin laden victory , but without all the waiting , intelligence gathering , and training .
11331 0 i 'm sure congress will have as many investigations as they did over benghazzi .
11332 1 well , he does know more than the generals
11333 0 this does n't fit your narrative .
11334 1 i miss obama , he and clinton never selectively created a narrative about gun violence to push their gun control objective .
11335 1 do n't you know that terrorism is only terrorism when it happens to white people .
11336 0 i do n't hear any fucking liberals condoning the violence in berkeley last night .
11337 0 could the reporter 's publication sue on the basis of freedom of the press ?
11338 1 he needs his safe space !
11339 0 what an embarrassment .

11343 1 like he did a great job with ca
11344 0 i 'd take a president who is constitutionally ineligible for office than a president who is constitutionally incapable of executing the duties of the office .

11349 1 * * failing ny times
11350 0 they are not going bankrupt , and to trump , that is the only positive business thing he knows .
11351 1 because imagine how hilarious the liberal reactions will be when the entire country is destroyed kekekekek
11352 0 they 'll just claim that liberals are being divisive , or some other stupid shit .
11353 0 the presidency .
11354 1 a 19 % stake in an oil company and other bits and bobs such as a presidency and some call girls .
11355 1 wow this is surprising .

11360 0 quality of those , poor to start with , is even dropping lower as time goes on .
11361 1 what could go wrong ?
11362 0 president bannon wastes no time , i see .
11363 1 but most americans voted for trump !
11364 0 running out of relevant narratives , are we now ?
11365 1 yeah , but that does n't account for the -20 point obama nomination hit that any candidate has to overcome first .
11366 0 none of this is about issues any more .
11367 0 that 's what i thought !
11368 1 the missing 12 % does n't know what impeach means .
11369 1 i 'm sure he will come into meetings with a complete understanding of what is to be discussed fully informed on the issues , just so prepared
11370 0 i do n't even know what the hell he wants out of this .
11371 1 this wo n't end badly
11372 0 this is literally going to backfire .
11373 1 how dare that reporter be mexican and a legal citizen !
11374 0 this aide is the one behind the twitter leaks , they just did it to keep their cover .
11375 1 we should just install gun vending machines throughout the nation .

11377 1 why would we want unpolluted streams
11378 0 the gop is made up of captain planet villains .
11379 1 but dems wo n't give this issue up !
11380 0 it 's like they want to arm random maniacs who want to become shooters .

11389 0 i think the strategy is to throw so much shit around that the public and media are n't able to give enough attention to any of it .
11390 1 just what the working class needs !
11391 1 majority of the participants in this survey are illegal mexicans and muslim terrorists , plus statistics is a hoax by the chinese to undermine our dear leader .

11412 0 hey mccain , trump is n't going to let facts get in the way of this one , you 're going to have to do a little more than send mildly worded letters that he is n't going to read .
11413 1 that seems like a perfectly stable and rational thing to do
11414 0 go back to playing cod .
11415 1 i am sure trump was civil and diplomatic .
11416 0 add one more to the list .
11417 1 but really , do presidents need to be there ?

11432 1 these 40 % ers need to don their `` love trumps hate '' t-shirts and go out and beat up a few more trump supporters .
11433 0 a hoax perpetuated by people so powerful and diabolical that they could hire actors to fill an entire town for years and years , but so inept that they rehired actors from other crises and arranged for port-a-potties ahead of time .
11434 1 that 's more dedication that the truman show !
11435 0 not if devos has anything to say about it .

11879 0 i give him two months .
11880 1 rasmussen says he 's got a 78 % approval rating though !

12788 1 carson , as a former surgeon , will sure know how `` cut '' hud down to trump 's size .
12789 1 no way for this to come back and bite them in the butt
12790 0 if this story breaks the same way the flynn story did , we can expect the nyt or wp to publish an article saying the fbi has a tape of sessions talking with kislyak about relieving sanctions on russia .
12791 0 and you guys would be defending him .
12792 1 the law only applies to democrats .

12800 1 that makes him smart .
12801 0 some people elected trump because he is an aggressive businessman and will save the government money by running it like a business , they forgot though that he is also an incompetent fuckwad .
12802 1 but we have to remember that laws only apply to democrats
12803 1 he sounds very principled .
12804 0 because republicans never say mean things .
12805 1 yeah , it 's democrats who have to tread lightly here
12806 0 there is no comparison , benghazi was a made up story ; russian interference with usa election and possible trump collusion is a big deal
12807 0 the hits just keep on coming .
12808 1 but trump knew nothing about it .
12809 0 simply lovely , he is .

12832 0 hehehehehehe he said aol ... heh
12833 1 but he read off a teleprompter once , he 's presidential !
12834 0 it 'd be nice but do n't hold your breath .
12835 0 i 'm starting to think trump may be a liar .
12836 1 well the only people that told him was nyt and wapo so it must be fake .
12837 0 trump supporter confuses 'slush ' with 'sushi ' , embarrassing himself on the internet .

12843 0 you guys need to arm up and have a good old fashioned revolution .
12844 1 all that fox news watching and tweeting takes a lot of energy , he needs a florida vacation 2 of 3 weekends to recharge .
12845 1 do n't bring bannon 's love of butt plugs into this
12846 0 clearly not .
12847 1 scandalous !
12848 0 i 'm sure that was totally organic

12856 0 probably easier to count cabinet members that have not made false statements ... just saying
12857 1 are these the same americans that said hillary would win ?
12858 0 except offcourse our very honorable comrades from the_toiletbowl
12859 1 they probably had significant evidence that would put hillary clinton in jail .
12860 0 i wonder how many of them meet trump or his surragates
12861 0 people who have researched these things , how much does this resemble someone on a really gnarly coke binge ?
12862 1 yeah , clearly this is corroborated by hard evidence which will soon be released to the public as opposed to a shameless attempt to distract from his alleged ties to russia .
12863 1 # the patriot act
12864 0 ... ahh .... so it was clinton .
12865 1 perhaps with the mods deleting my responses , it will make you more right .
12866 0 but what does president bannon think ?

12881 0 so the man who lied under oath about wiretapping all americans comes out to claim he did n't wiretap one specific person or building and we 're supposed to believe that ?
12882 1 well , it 's not like clapper has lied about wiretapping before .
12883 1 old news .
12884 0 he should be locked up for perjury .
12885 1 who needs classified briefings or other intelligence reports when you have breitbart to give you the real facts .
12886 0 ca n't wait to see spicy get up there and defend breitbart as real news
12887 1 yeah , it was such a total success before the r 's got elected
12888 0 republi '' care ''
12889 1 wow , i 'm glad they are investigating something with facts supporting it with all of our tax dollars .
12890 0 nunes is such a scumbag .
12891 0 the important part is the train thinks it is still on the track
12892 1 and those illegals !
12893 1 # spicy
12894 0 it 's becoming clear that there is a direct correlation between trump 's outbursts on social media and cable tv news segments ( see : sweden )
12895 0 too bad this administration or its supporters do n't give a shit about polls or public opinion .
12896 1 it would n't be a majority if they did n't poll all of those illegals .
12897 1 yeah , ranting against china and kicking traditional us allies by cancelling tpp is bound to create stronger ties .
12898 0 technically , yes , we 're already seeing those ties since russia is technically in asia ... in fact , there 's a pretty strong tie from the kremlin to little donnie 's balls .
12899 0 yeah , because that was the only issue with the ban .
12900 1 because banning iraqi 's was totally the issue everyone had with the first travel ban
12901 1 this is just a coincidence .
12902 0 there 's a russian official in the us , they can take care of ... just saying
12903 0 he 's busy adding pyrotechnics to the motorized podium .
12904 1 why talk to the press when they 're the enemy ?
12905 0 it 's the same as it ever was .

12907 1 this should be fun for everyone who is n't a billionaire .
12908 0 pandora 's box come to real life .
12909 1 sure sucks when a country sets up tough border patrol does n't it ?
12910 0 this being reddit no one is going to actually fact check this before grabbing their torches and pitchforks .
12911 1 but they totally do n't have a favorite .
12912 0 my only framework here is the tv show `` the good wife '' - but there was an episode where russian hackers got control over a law firm 's entire computer network and then demanded a ransom be paid to 'give it back ' to them .
12913 0 so , how 's the russia treason investigation coming along , sean ?
12914 1 nice way to keep the fbi independent of political pressure after hoover .
12915 0 this is the best they could come up with in 4 days .
12916 1 oh well that settles that then .
12917 0 is the offer not extortion ?
12918 1 i 'm sure this is all part of donald `` master negotiator art of the deal '' trump 's plan .

12927 1 such a maverick !
12928 0 we all know it 's just a distraction
12929 0 shocking !
12930 1 wow what an orginal plan
12931 0 republicare at its best
12932 1 i am so glad they are making changes that really matter .
12933 1 we provide these tax cuts to our benevolent overlords so that perhaps they shine kindly down on us , showering us with entry level positions and reduced premiums .
12934 0 i 'm fully in support of raising the highest tax bracket back up to 90 % like it was in the 20s
12935 1 of course it does .
12936 0 well if your love one loses coverage and dies , you know who to go after
12937 1 i 'm shocked !
12938 0 that photo is incredibly sad .

12947 1 trumpcare is going to the the greatest !
12948 0 do n't undersell this : h.r.1275 - 115th congress ( 2017-2018 ) : * * world 's greatest healthcare plan * * of 2017 - potus
12949 0 this is hard for people to hear , but totally true , and it cuts the heart of what 's wrong with liberalism
12950 1 this guy clearly knows a lot about poor people .
12951 0 just call it exactly what it is : republicare
12952 1 well we would n't want to * prevent * any healthcare problems .
12953 1 because censoring the u.s president is a great idea when i disagree with him !
12954 0 did n't work here .
12955 0 t_d is really out in force trying to sweep this under the rug .
12956 1 surely , it 's just a coincidence that wikileaks chose today to publish a dump that will give the trump campaign the `` it 's all a cia false flag defense . ''
12957 0 he sweats bullets walking from his office to the bathroom , right now he is sweating cannon balls
12958 1 his brilliant idea as permanent head of nsc really working out !
12959 0 oh , look , the people who brought us `` if you like your plan , you can keep it '' are now giving us a new insightful and totally trustworthy analysis .
12960 1 maybe it 'll only affect the 6 to 10 million illegals that voted for clinton .
12961 1 i 'm shocked
12962 0 rebublicare : just fucking die , you poor shits !
12963 0 if you stop buying iphones you 'll be fine do n't worry about it .
12964 1 so as long as they all buy three less iphones every year , everything will be fine !
12965 1 that 's coming after sharia law .
12966 0 still waiting on republicans to ban abortion .
12967 0 umm as much as i like this story i think it violates the rules ... very very old
12968 1 bannon says there 's nothing to this story , so that must be the truth .
12969 0 signalling the invasion will come by sea .
12970 1 well , it is n't like the coast guard is part of the military and our first line of defense against outside threats .
12971 0 so much for sunbelt republican representatives .
12972 1 maybe it 's the death panels the republicans put into the bill .
12973 0 why come to america when you can go somewhere else
12974 1 it 's a good thing tourism is n't vital to our economy
12975 0 they have to use the whitest looking arab to push white genocide .
12976 1 i feel so much safer knowing this guy who fled torture to the usa and is an invested member of his community here and works extensively on humanitarian projects ca n't rejoin his pregnant wife and classmates .
12977 0 but he drained the swamp !
12978 1 but at least it 's not that corrupt hilary .

12980 1 details are bullshit !
12981 0 lies .
12982 1 well , apparently there are a lot more jobs when people are getting paid for protesting town halls .
12983 1 ha , republican governors concerned about people getting healthcare ...... this has to be fake news
12984 0 i think governors may get bribed by a different set of people than congressmen , so their pleas may fall on deaf ears .
12985 0 are you so sure about the 'free ' part ?
12986 1 but look at all those jobs they 're creating though
12987 0 tyranny and dictators throughout history have served up `` * those dirty despicable others * '' so that they could blame everything wrong in society on them and the rest of the population could feel superior .
12988 1 clearly the solution is huge tax cuts for the extremely wealthy .
12989 0 i bet this is negatively correlated with quality of education
12990 1 does this data include the 3-5 million illegals who voted ?
12991 1 yes , trump is notorious for taking no heed of any criticism of him
12992 0 still , maybe not in a few months or years
12993 0 trumped up trickledown treasonomics
12994 1 they 'll pass the savings on to all of us !
12995 1 better defund `` fake news '' pbs and npr
12996 0 i think this is just what the big 3 news ( cbs , abc , nbc ) used to be 20+ years ago .
12997 0 why is there and `` if '' in the title of this post ?
12998 1 blame obama
12999 1 besides , he does n't recall what they talked about , so it 's not like it matters anyways

13012 0 hush money .
13013 1 there was recently that time when obama was going to take over the state with us special forces , or the time when they were going to kidnap bush ave turn him into a muslim , or the 50 times when they were coming to take our guns away ... and that 's just in the past 8 years
13014 0 well , they did beg uncle sam to help them against mexican farmers and peasant

13036 1 the minute trump took office they started falling out of the sky
13037 1 with his extensive background in law , we should hold his views on science as gospel .

13047 1 yikes here guys , take this

13049 1 was clinton going to end sanctions before or after she declared war against russia and started ww3 ?
13050 0 throwing a few dollars business podesta 's way does not make up for the billions worth of value of owning a us president .
13051 0 i wonder how many iphones that can buy .

13249 1 i wonder who he voted for
13250 0 the waiter went straight home and posted on t_d .
13251 1 because the united states press has been unreasonably kind to trump thus far .

13273 1 poor and homeless are losers , trumps a winner

13293 0 i really liked the last line : `` bannon is like if the tire mud flap with the giant-breasted silhouette got a library card . ''

13301 1 what about those jobs he `` created '' that was report last week ?
13302 0 and with a 37 % approval rating and the fact that paul ryan would suck my dick if he could magically replace trump with pence or literally with any other republican on earth at this point , i do n't see the next few years getting any easier for trump .

13367 0 the problem i have is that the president is like a lot of my republican friends and family that think that lincoln was n't a progressive and was a conservative like the modern day republicans .
13368 1 next trump will reveal to us that few people know that lincoln used to love eating at `` lincoln 's waffle shop '' across the street from the hard rock cafe on 10th street near where the busses drop off all the tourists for ( the very famous ) ford 's theater .
