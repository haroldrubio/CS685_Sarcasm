0 oh right , * both * wars were just jewish conspiracies to reclaim the homeland of israel .
1 good luck with that .
2 and this is exactly why i approve of death panels .
3 this is pure xenophobia against vaticanians !
4 clinton 's budget surpluses = the post-cw peace dividend bush 's budget deficits = the post-911 war on terrorism obama 's budget deficits = the post-rage socialist takeover ps -- dailykos is a supreme example of charlatan targeting of a public that has been methodically dumbed down by the education system 's key players
5 teabagging apperently just the tip of the iceberg
6 who ever heard of a volcano causing problems for people ?
7 it 's to enhance our freedom of speech
8 yah , at that point they do n't even count as people anymore !
9 as a person the cop would n't of opened his fucking mouth .
10 it does n't but you can not get upvotes unless you sensationalize the headline .
11 kind of hard to give anal sex an even worse name but as it turns out most anything is possible .
12 because if we do n't fight the wars , the terrorists win .
13 u mad ?
14 where are * our * jobs ?
15 scum tends to stay near the top , while the good stuff is found below .
16 what you ca n't see is that they 're jerking each other off out of frame .
17 those must be some pretty tough soldiers to have to put up air conditioned tents .
18 `` let 's stone her ! ! ! ! ''
19 it sets a precedent , and the battle 's lost .
20 capitalism ftw
21 i 'm sorry , but bombing every country that has a vowel is way more important than their citizens well being .
22 are you at all concerned that your headline is not supported by * anything * in the linked article ?
23 breaking news .
24 only a true visionary like rmoney can sense what his audience wants and give it to them .
25 they 're making sure that evil kenyan mooslim gets thrown out so they can give tax cuts to the rich and let the prosperity trickle down , obviously .
26 lol wow imagine that , wordplay that makes the story a lie and coming from msnbc ... shocking
27 oh , those are n't * real * christians anyway .
28 we need job creators , not bolshevik indoctrination centers .
29 i would love to see how the liberals would react it the situation was reversed .
30 2nd amendment strikes again
31 republican 's immediately attacked president obama for his egregious abuse of the first amendment .
32 i still can fathom the stupidity of the whole tea party movement .
33 because they will be millionaires like romney one day !
34 i watch fox news because mainstream media is so biased .
35 because people ca n't change jobs or get a different insurance
36 why do you hate america ?
37 that teacher just is n't a `` team player '' .
38 gasp , the injustice of not being able to be a resident of multiple states
39 two shit heads doing the wrong thing
40 listen i was told by ron paul people that the parties are the same and it does n't matter if i do n't vote or vote 3rd party , thereby taking a vote away from the democrats .
41 what garbage .
42 i love how the entire internet is seemingly against the republican party because the party is comprised of retards and yet they 're still going to win a pile of states ... how fucked is your country that these idiots are actually getting votes and winning ?
43 obviously , tropical depression 9 is an obama plot to destroy the rnc .
44 they done gone full retard .
45 i would have gone with indefinite detention or torture , but i guess welfare is pretty bad too .
46 the coulter quotes ... wow , just wow .
47 well , about 80-90 % of reddit either ca n't vote yet or are too lazy to actually get up off their asses and go vote so whats the point of posting this stuff , your opinion does n't matter much if you wo n't even vote .
48 `` the fbi claims to have evidence that a group of anarchists from new york are planning to blow bridges in tampa in florida '' and how many of the group are fbi agents or informants ?
49 then take the sum and divide by 2 - the repug way
50 good thing there were n't any of those nutjobs with ccws there or things might have got out of hand and innocent bystanders would have been shot by those untrained yahoos .
51 it musty have been really pretty out there , until it was n't .
52 i 've looked at this blog 's articles and see no apparent bias
53 because both parties are the same
54 wow this is the first bush to ever lie to the public .
55 better than a few years back when the police actually arrested journalists .
56 nice of him to take his snout out of the trough long enough to squeal for the cameras .
57 poverty line in congo looks a lot worse than here .

61 frack it , right ?
62 if i had the money i would leave too .
63 the gop certainly is n't perpetuating it 's misogynistic image here .
64 exactly .
65 it is what god wants .
66 and the same respondents supported the aca , but hated obamacare .
67 obama wants people to die from the shutdown so he can blame it on the gop .
68 100 % of americans have the gov't they deserve .
69 that 's it ?
70 yes because they are equally to blame .
71 the romney campaign has announced another reboot .
72 pat robertson ... the voice of reason .
73 yesssss
74 `` i believe children are our future ... unless we stop them here and now ! ''
75 oh no , whatever will she do !
76 obviously we need to start arming bus drivers .
77 because the terrorists put them there
78 how could rp deny his citizens all that free money ?
79 ad hominem .
80 `` with no one officer being suspended for more than 10 days '' makes sense , it was only an average of 2 shots per officer
81 there is no climate change , so stop saying that !
82 and the democrats have a different statistic ?
83 `` well , you see , the problem will just sort itself out ... ''
84 how do they all fit in the basement ?
85 clearly medicare is n't competing for top talent .
86 glad he is continuing to use our tax dollars wisely !
87 if verizon breaks the barrier all the other isps will follow suit .
88 military spending is the third most spent on item so shut up about your freedom you get from the soldiers
89 sure , when republicans stop chopping the legs out from under them and do their jobs for a change .
90 they should have went to college so they could get better jobs .
91 politifact says : mostly true .
92 giving this man more attention was exactly what he wanted .
93 i have a feeling that if all of the so called gop leaders were recorded speaking their true feelings that the country would be completely shocked .
94 americans even outsource their reloutionary leaders .
95 the new world order is the real threat , the only real question is whether it takes over before or after the coming armageddon/rapture/apocalypse .
96 she 's got another book she did n't write to sell to people who do n't read .
97 since no one believes alexander , clapper , and etc any more , they are now reduced to whining that the press is being mean to them .
98 thanks tea hadists
99 of course it is , the crazy rich ones need more riches to have more to trickle down
100 as someone from brazil , indiana ... i got ta say that i 'm disappointed ...
101 the nut does n't fall far from the tree .
102 improving things for non-billionaires is contrary to republican goals , so obamacare must be destroyed .
103 but they were all violent thugs who deserved to be shot !
104 now we know what the new rules are : open carry for whites , open season on blacks .
105 thanks obama ?
106 itt : appalled adolescents
107 have n't you heard , the red states are sovereign nations .
108 i wonder how long it 'll take for nothing to happen
109 the hague .
110 five words : reid china solar cliven bundyghazi
111 is this different from any typical company dress code ?
112 great , we know video evidence helped bring charges against the cop ( s ) who killed eric garner with suffocation .
113 are n't they ones always going on about the `` nanny state '' ?
114 oh yeah , well obama said you can keep you health insurance if you like it , so there .
115 this defines the party .
116 oh joy
117 i thought it was a rainbow bumper sticker .
118 but ..... terrorists
119 apparently he is an expert on comatose women though .
120 i keep thinking , we were at different times a pretzel and a shoe strike away from cheney being president .
121 $ 22 million , that is about what the us spends on booze every 4 hours .
122 i 'm sure they 're motivated by genuine concern and just want to do the right thing .
123 well , that was a helpful comment .
124 impeach the sexist .
125 it did n't work in one state so it 'll never work anywhere !
126 it 's all obama 's fault ... wait , no , i meant , not his fault this one time when something is positive .
127 i say small government should start with him .
128 gas prices have nothing to do with obama .. the saudi 's are trying to get back a sizable market share by putting shale oil out of business .
129 yeah , but how many people are employed to keep them on the streets
130 what a joke .
131 give us new idiots with new bad ideas and new false beliefs .
132 it takes all types .
133 an opinion piece from a bloomberg journalist .
134 fucking socialism , they need to be gathered up and shipped out of the country .
135 obviously they are telling us that the odds are stacked against bernie and we need to fight harder to defeat the evil establishment !
136 shh , brush this under the rug until a republican is in office and then blame them
137 democratic people 's republic of america
138 great title
139 it is a tie , but all mainstream media are saying that clinton wins because the rich people behind the mainstream media are extremely desperate and are already knowing that they will definitely lose .
140 conspiracy !
141 yeah , that win in bernie 's 3rd more demographically favorable state after bernie got to focus months and months and lots of money on it certainly is bad news .
142 that was so unexpected
143 when he 's elected , that $ 5 per month i 've been sending bernie is guaranteed to come back as a million dollar federal contract !
144 i mean , pull up your pants already , amirite ?
145 this is a shocker .
146 good night sweet prince
147 based on his campaign rhetoric he will eliminate our government then fire himself .
148 man , how dare sanders point out the criminal 's constant lying ...... what shameful behavior
149 you would think african-americans would be grateful for that extra $ 600 a year
150 whats wrong with that ?
151 the guy who signed the alien and sedition acts said it , so it must be right .
152 more internet for blacks !
153 but its only because it a neighboring state of vermont nothing to see here
154 if you take 200 grand from pharmaceutical companies then probably yes .
155 could have stopped the title at `` hillary clinton still out of touch '' .
156 goldman sachs lobbyist and fundraiser brings hillary to dem debate *
157 words defeat numbers : sanders is not electable even though he polls better than clinton every single time .
158 but you know , this does n't mean she will compromise her values in anyway .
159 these are required criteria ?
160 so what ?
161 yeah i cant think of one thing thats harder for muslims than white people
162 maybe he could pressure her into making a few pledges as the price of his endorsement ?
163 because shame buys a yacht .
164 trump will then charged , convicted and executed for genocide , hopefully bush will be the last president who got away with war crimes .
165 well , there should be a special place in hell for these women .
166 what 's it say about our system when a billionaire opens to the possibility of running for public office to a media outlet that locked behind a paywall .
167 yeah , i 'm sure that russia is going to attack members of nato and the eu .
168 berniebros
169 she brought a gs lobbyist to the last debate as her guest such shaming .
170 after only 15 years !
171 im sure this will do well on a pro sanders subreddit .
172 the how much matters just as much as the win for both these guys
173 i love when the poll came out showing women under 30 supporting bernie in the 80s % , and dudes were tweeting `` i 'm with bernie because that 's where the girls are ! ''
174 they probably just did it to impress all us handsome young bernie bros .
175 well , because clearly that sex is a threat to national security ; the drinking water is just a minor issue for some people who really do not ever vote .
176 just yesterday i saw him ranting about going against the states that legalized marijuana ... how did that not solidify his presidential bid ?
177 yeah , because three strikes was way too lenient .
178 i hope madeline albright criticizes all the women who supported bernie sanders instead of carly fiorino .
179 that would make sense ... she is the establishment candidate , after all .
180 clinton will be done if this happens
181 he must be high !
182 no guys this is good now he can go back to prosecuting those damn 9/11 terrorists .
183 clinton : so like with a sharpener ?
184 that worked for them in 1980 , why not try it again .
185 this is the hillary campaign starting to get extra dirty as she gets more and more desperate to stop losing voters .
186 thank goodness our good information providers present this topic somewhere every day because it is essential to our economic and political well being .
187 one hand washes the other .
188 i thought reagan smashed the wall
189 you sexist !
190 who knew that exorcism was n't an effective way to eliminate the state 's deficit ?
191 freedom is n't free yall
192 but would you be as good a politician to even have the chance ?
193 anybodybuthillary 2016 !
194 corruption and theft of american resources at an unprecedented level .... paid for by the lives of many .
195 did anyone in this thread even read the article ?
196 but how else will we lock up the blacks ?
197 `` huffington post '' really credible news source you have there !
198 sanders !
199 because the democrats have never filibustered anything that they did n't agree with .
200 the gaffes .
201 it 's all so obama can appoint a super-ultra-liberal to the scotus so they can name him permanent supreme high chancellor .
202 i 'm more shocked this is written by npr
203 let 's just be surprised that cruz did n't walk out after being ganged up on , like he said he would in past debates .
204 i thought obama had him killed .
205 the catch 22 is they will first have a voter id law that only allows registered republicans to vote .
206 the law does n't apply to people with money and connections .
207 deja vu all over again .
208 it 's like clinton is a special interest to the rest of the dnc establishment .... but no one should expect that the dnc establiment would be swayed by hilary 's funding channels .
209 maybe the details of his demise were embarrassing ala david carradine maybe ?
210 lol @ cop doing his job with a cancer stick jammed in his mouth
211 but how will this cure racism ?
212 of course a fucking frog would say something of this nature , just look at how great their socialist economy is doing !
213 always a good use of tax money
214 this man is a danger to society .
215 socialism : punish success , reward failure .
216 wow what a scathing piece .
217 for comparison , the trio of previous polls in october and november had clinton up by between 25 and 35 points .
218 with cha boys .
219 yet another fine production by prager university .
220 hillary 's numbers continue to shrink , the the differences are declining not growing .
221 angry white person angry about white people
222 hold the heathen hammer high !
223 these polls are worthless .
224 try harder ?
225 why ca n't they respond back with a photoshopped image of ted cruz and obama talking to each other in front of the united nations building new york ?
226 it 's only a lie if you get caught !
227 no , no , no ... * * nixon * * was president then , so it was different .
228 proof that bernie sanders is a menace to society .
229 all i took from this post is that paragraphs are hard .
230 oh yes the donald with all his prosperity has really brought the hellfire over us in the past 40 years .
231 yeah , the status quo sure is inspiring : ' )
232 i ca n't possibly imagine why americans do n't want another bush in the white house .
233 i wonder who
234 if the poor want more political power then maybe they should go vote .
235 get ready for the new era where instead of `` corporations are people '' `` people are corporations '' .
236 any footage of where he 's been the last 50 years ?
237 that sounds really patronising .
238 how do electoral laws apply here ?
239 all they need to be able to do is read the numbers after a dollar sign and put an * x * on the dotted line .
240 the state , progress , it 's all the same , right !
241 by the same logic , it has not influenced every other strong willed politician .
242 i do n't know if i would be happy associating with spike lee after what he did to nba2k .
243 why could that be ?
244 vp material
245 but nevada was bernie 's death blow !
246 # whichhillary is tending keep it going !
247 and here i was thinking he 'd go carson .
248 i 'm sure she just a berniebro in disguise .
249 hillary is just trying to be a lead by example in the no encryption/digital security age !
250 but .. but trump claims he has good support among hispanics !
251 all tax plans are horrible and wildly immoral , let alone irresponsible .
252 the real truth is that these people treat minorities like pets , telling them what they should and who should they vote for then getting upset when minorities dont do what they want .
253 i 'm sure hillary is really scared now
254 innovation !
255 gee ... now there '' s a surprise !
256 still wants to spend money on nato to counter russian `` aggression '' in a part of the world we have no business being in .
257 20 years later she finally responds that 's a great leader for you !
258 because everyone loves grammar nazis
259 a promise is a promise , right ?
260 rubio seems focused on issues that matter .
261 this is a big reason why the threats to vote for trump from bernie supporters if clinton wing ring pretty hollow .
262 everyone who was shot in michigan by that uber driver could be covered by the same headline if you took out the word `` muslim '' but hey , yeah , it 's absolutely motivated by hate and not just a case of violent crime like it is when anyone else is tragically murdered .
263 seriously , they 're nearly as bad as the obama boys of 08 , amirite ?
264 is there a new rule where posts tagged as `` unacceptable title '' are allowed to stay up ?
265 i get all of that under obamacare .
266 yeah , they 're much happier now with isis !
267 that 's why she 's running for president -- to pardon herself .
268 ralph nader destroyed america
269 yay !
270 well this will surely end his campaign !
271 yeah , when a rich second cousins of one of americas favorite presidents , teddy roosevelt , entered politics , it surely was the end of the democrats
272 rubio rekt trump
273 right wing source
274 exactly what it is .
275 i get all my political insights from c-list celebrities .
276 trump supporters totally are n't racist so it just does n't matter how racist we look in front of 7 billion people because we are n't .
277 why would you want nunes gone ?
278 trying to think about how many lied during their confirmation hearings is like trying to figure out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop
279 even that version is pretty terrible .
280 sounds like he 's trying to help them .
281 fuck the environment - punk rock
282 soros is running out of cash .
283 the first line of rhe article reads : `` there is still no evidence of russian interference in the election of 2016 '' ok , then ...
284 which is against the law !
285 could he have simply forgot ?
286 it 's okay , he reported that income on his russian tax form .
287 are you trump voters tired of winning yet ?
288 true but dems have lacked the balls to call them on it
289 politicians do n't give a s $ $ t about people
290 i think the title is a bit misleading , should read : `` * soros 's paid protesters attack honorable man trying to serve his community * ''
291 but ... mexico is going to pay for the wall ... r ... right ?
292 can you imagine , your child was shot at school ... and the audacity of these alex jones fanatics .. to harass you about it .
293 he should show his concern with his votes ; his words do n't mean anything anymore .
294 as well as being an all around piece of shit .
295 i 'm sure he had an excellent time taking trump 's sand wedge in up to his duodenum .
296 the `` tolerant '' left showing its evil side once again
297 you know i want to click on the link , but i really do n't want to give fox any more clicks .
298 that makes him smart .
299 this should be a front of the news story that trump has to answer to .
300 as long as it was not a white supremacist terrorist attack he will comment .
301 way to high .
302 please , like conservatives can afford starbucks .
303 is this the beginning of project mayhem ?
304 the air is going to be so much better once all those pesky clean air rules are gone , you can get a sample of it by breathing in the air that comes out of your car 's tailpipe
305 wow that is so many !
306 he 's only taking money from the government , not from me .
307 on mike flynn 's seeking immunity : `` that 's not asking for immunity . ''
308 who do you guys think the top 3 bad actors are going to wind up being and why ?
309 \ * peni .
310 what a wonderful time to be alive
311 shocking !
312 i get the sense women who support trumps do n't work .
313 something something coal something something tremendous tax cuts .
314 trump apologists argue natsec adviser wanting to know who is colluding w massive russian active measures plan is doing something wrong
315 slouching toward that death panel .
316 but obama was an illegal kenyan so he does n't know how a * real * presidency works
317 i thought brownback was going to balance the budget with a bake sale .
318 okay , do it turtleman .
319 yes i 'm sure they wholeheartedly supported the candidate who was most critical of them .
320 aka participating in democracy .
321 but let 's just see what rasmussen has to say first , before we jump to any conclusions .
322 is n't it simpler to just figure out which of them did n't meet with russians ?
323 yes , and it 's free , thanks to the trump epa .
324 at least the mexicans are going to pay for it
325 `` thousands waste their time ''
326 but he 's saving us thousands by donating his salary .
327 is is because trump might be grabbing ivanka by her p * * * y behind the scenes ?
328 american 's did n't want donald trump in the white house .
329 but ensuring human rights would mean taking away people 's choice ( to not have human rights if they want , and their personal responsibility to have to fight for the rights on their own .
330 aww those beautiful christian morals , so good to see after that horrible muslim
331 coming from a misogynist sexual assault loving piece of shit not that surprising .
332 got ta keep them evil furriners from spreading the word of how things like universal health care are a success in their countries .
333 good , christian values by good , christian people
334 ca n't they just subpoena them ?
335 cancel the wall ?
336 there 's that r word again .
337 i did not serve so i can see shit like this .
338 `` you think our country is so innocent ? ''
339 pay no attention to the catholic behind the curtain .
340 but some political t_d geniuses said what she did eclipses watergate , whomever am i to believe ?
341 i used to dream of being and doing many things in my life , but it 's all been reduced to just one thing lately ... move to cali cali .
342 got ta love that username .
343 fox news : obama !
344 i love when someone gets their bluff called and then completely bitches out doubly so when it 's a scumbag like bannon
345 but it 's okay because it 's legal and wolves are pests just like elephants .
346 because nothing is more alpha than running down wolves to the point of exhaustion from a helicopter and then shooting them
347 hey trump supporters , you were all 100 % right : trump is definitely * not * using the presidency to enrich himself and his family
348 yeah but 6/10 americans are also illegal immigrants
349 `` the days of 'trust me ' science are over '' how bout the same for `` trust me '' politics ?
350 and hillary , and soros , and bill , and podesta
351 why not celebrate an enemy of the united states , who initiated a military attack and made war against our country ?
352 he was so successful when investigating hillary .
353 murdered the american tourism industry .
354 but that 's in white man dollars , so it 's okay .
355 thankfully we can count on the noble democrats to return the senate to a 60-vote threshold as soon as they have a senate majority
356 lmao , fucking owned .
357 he was just threatening to de-operationalize his position in the administration .
358 an exemplary display of his purported `` christian values '' .
359 he ca n't loose , alex said `` it 's over for the globalists ''
360 do n't forget blinding stupidity .
361 the smoke screen is heavy tonight .
362 where 's the megathread ?
363 and it begins .. probably to distract from the increasing seriousness of the russian election interference probe .
364 but i thought hillary was the one that was going to start a war .
365 and if he didnt do something all of you would be bitching no matter what he does you all will bitch
366 this was probably putins idea to launch a strike on a secondary airbase
367 in other news : people with well-stocked pantries and refrigerators less hungry than those with little to no food .
368 well he is black after all
369 that was a different time , by then only ~300000 were killed , now with the gas attacks it is ~300083 , completely different situation
370 ohhhhhh shit .
371 man , i 'm really getting tired of all this `` winning '' .
372 obama 's fault !
373 if trump fires bannon , and it is because of the `` president bannon '' jokes and how they made him feel lesser-than ... then we have some serious problems .
374 what better way to stop the flow of syrian refugees than to strike at their source ?
375 how could anyone have ever predicted this ?
376 thank god , devos is gon na sleep better at night now
377 i am sure it was a secure location .
378 yeay .. look at the republican propaganda machine .. they are like those annoying people who have to one up you with their own story .
379 yeah , but we can open american missile silos !
380 19th dimension chess using a tardis with a flux capacitor .

383 if you extend that to the first family it 's more than once a day .
384 looks like their meeting went well .
385 it 's getting pathetic at this point !
386 more of the r 's war on women .
387 in case you were wondering if andrew cuomo was going to run for president or not .
388 did n't see this coming ....

390 that 4d chess huh magas
391 awesome sauce sources
392 because the last few `` regime changes '' we did went so well !
393 'even though 1/5 of the district ca n't legally vote ' .... like that ever stopped democrats ,
394 bold leadership .
395 expert
396 i 'm sure he 's got trump scared with the one .
397 sucks being a loser
398 your average high school year book team would have more clarity of purpose and organized delivery than this wh .
399 it 's coming any day now .
400 this will surely be the end of drumpf
401 he probably owns investments in the private prison industry .
402 this is the best answer .
403 got tired of winning after election
404 i can just see the amazing state sponsored movies they 'd make about it : nepotism unit 45 saving private erik apocalypse yuge hamburger drive thru thin white line full metal hairgel spittoon orange hawk down all quiet on the westin front .
405 i prefer to just say breitbart is controlled by the illuminati , at least that 's what i think i 'm going to tell my coworker who is a rabid trump supporter
406 because they are n't paid * directly * by the government so it 's completely different guys , they are a unbiased source of news
407 so they 've made peace on whatever started their tiff or bannon no longer sees a benefit from it and is going for the long game .
408 mexico is totally gon na pick this tab up because they love trump .
409 * dons tinfoil hat * they 're preparing for the coup attempt !
410 but those poor rural states need their insane overrepresentation
411 we got the head of the judicial branch , legislative and executive branch this year !
412 obviously the solution is more guns
413 at least mccain can back up his claim with some kind of intel , it 's not in this article but i 'm certain it will come out soon
414 i pray that , somewhere in fbi headquarters , someone read this today and thought to themselves `` just keep running your yap , prisoner . ''
415 but ... obama went to hawaii !
416 but the government ca n't create jobs !
417 and us tanks were n't right outside of baghdad .
418 did anyone call sean hannity ?
419 i 'm tired of all this winning
420 i want to know melania 's thoughts on this .
421 trump does not really love coal miners
422 luckily trump is smarter than the generals .
423 obviously ~~jesus~~ trump doesnt have to attend because he is chosen by god !
424 but at least they 're not liberals !
425 women are generally on the right side of history
426 well , if he 's done drugs and had sex , then the protections of the law no longer apply to him
427 it only takes so long defending donald trump before you want to move on to bigger challenges and what 's left apart from trying to redeem hitler ?
428 dumber than a bag of hammers
429 can you imagine if that muslim , barack hussein obama had denounced jesus on december 26th , 2009 ?
430 college is not for everyone .
431 would be hilarious to have this actually go before a court and have them explain what god is and how he he is `` almighty '' in the context of our law .
432 tune in tomorrow for another episode of `` is the fbi good or is it bad depending on what we prefer on /redacted ''
433 i , for one , am shocked
434 oh joy , it 's been a while since i 've had a good ole election day disappointment .
435 between this exclusive , and the wapo carter page exclusive , this has been a real bad news hour for the trump administration and its gop enablers .
436 let 's start with every elected white house official
437 but who is going to constantly remind me of the persecution good christians like himself face all the time ?
438 not just imaging if instead of acting like babies the bernie brats actuall turned out for hillary this would have more than a snowballs chance in hell .
439 take him away boys .
440 mexico confirms this .
441 trump hires only the best people !
442 thank god we have an ag who openly supports legal marijuana , and intelligently dismisses the ludicrous views we owe to the nixon administration .
443 here 's a reminder that trump wants to slash funding to the great lakes by 97 % .
444 she reminds me of sterling archer 's mom .
445 getting some major republic of gilead vibes here .
446 do n't matter she 's still a dirty escort .
447 the important question we need to be asking is - how does this proof that obama wiretapped trump and his other political opponents ?
448 hahaha
449 ron howard vo : he was .
450 i 've heard something about sessions , but i do n't have any sources .
451 was it written in crayon , by a man with tiny hands ?
452 as they should be .
453 that should go over well .
454 here 's a better idea : stop supporting trump 's shitty ideas and appointees .
455 `` loaned ''
456 another case of burdensome regulations trying to keep down the entrepreneurial spirit .
457 lol sure glad we did n't get that ~~war hawk~~ ~~globalist~~ wall street sell-out hitlery !
458 was it a laugh or a guffaw ?
459 wait does that mean a breitbart story might make the front page of reddit ?
460 he just `` became '' president .. again .. for the 3rd time now
461 brb guys i am going to touch myself over how presidential he is being
462 shit , trump was eating chocolate cake again .
463 because trump is saving the lives of innocent babies .
464 all news is agenda driven when there 's money involved .
465 so glad we put that purity test on that warhawk clinton .
466 he 's finally acting presidential
467 but her emails !
468 obama made him do it
469 did he read it on wikileaks ?
470 well i guess that whole civilian oversight thing was over rated .
471 now that he 's figured out he can control the narrative by killing people , expect more of this .
472 shows how useless us intelligence is , even with its bloated budgets and numerous agencies , or perhaps they 're not much changed since 9/11 and still do n't coordinate
473 do n't forget that clean water is also personal so if you do n't like lead in your water , do n't drink it
474 our ignorant troll president is going to get a lot of people killed before he 's through .
475 if you 've never had your face melted by an 11 ton thermobaric explosive , you have n't experienced true freedom .
476 glad the press learned its lesson cheerleading the cruise missile strike .
477 you go girl ?
478 fix your headline .
479 but but he was n't president then , guys !
480 how so ?
481 well then the public should assume the risk is very high .
482 imagine the backroom pressure he is exerting to get a knighthood .
483 they got to him .
484 bububububut what about barrack hussein obama and his army of secret muslim drones taking over texas with concentration camps for white people obama drone blahrhghlsjd gay frogs chemtrails gubmint takin mah jerbs
485 maybe she should 've thought of the repercussions of her actions before going to a riot with the aim of `` collecting nazi scalps '' , lmao equal rights , equal lefts
486 to be fair those guys were never actually paid .
487 our taxes prove that we are not being paid to protest his orange , obese ass .
488 this is n't going after fuck all , it 's another bullshit non-sequitur .
489 prove it or shut the fuck up donny .
490 isnt this place starting to run low on people ?
491 maybe he can order a round of nukes with his dessert .
492 it 's not the they would n't research , it 's that they believe everything reported outside their batshit crazy right wing media bubble is straight up false .
493 he is a vile piece of shit and anyone who supports him and is fully aware about his `` business practices '' are vile pieces of shit too .
494 no ... he 's just lying to the judges so he can get custody , you have to play the game or the illimanti will get you
495 why wo n't somebody call sean hannity !
496 because fuck the obamas that 's why .
497 lol he broadcasts from home
498 the stakes are too high ... they should always be stored at 45 degrees or less !
499 why is this news ?
500 more went to the tax rallies then went to trump 's innaguration
501 what does it matter , he won .
502 their slow deaths will make america great again
503 is anyone besides the msm and his brain addled followers praising him ?
504 it 's videos like this , that remind me how unamerican tan suits and dijon mustard truly are .
505 it takes a megalomaniac dictator with delusions of godliness to understand a megalomaniac dictator with delusions of godliness .
506 they wo n't , because unlike the far-left , centrists actually vote .
507 bribery deserves privacy
508 sad !
509 duh , we all know this is because women ca n't get pregnant from legitimate rape !
510 so if you can hand shake a lot of money for someone , all citizens rights be damned .
511 try some subtlety sometime for fuck 's sake .
512 gosh , that secret muslim terrorist born in kenya & amp ; his nutrition nazi wife really ruined the spirit of easter , did n't they ?
513 if anyone 's to blame , it 's the reagan administration .
514 thank you thinkprogess for another unbiased , independent `` news '' article .
515 seems legit .
516 no , god did that .
517 if anything he seems adverse to it
518 it is not soon enough .
519 mexico is going to struggle to pay for that !
520 there are a lot of social political and environmental issues with this of course we are more self aware of the actual local consequences of a border wall .
521 he might be capable of only leering , that part might not be his fault .
522 they should hire mercenaries instead , privatizing our military would make it more efficient and cost effective .
523 but ... bu ... bu ... 4chan pulled one over the msm , right ?
524 trump will soon blame obama for his high cholesterol , hair loss , and orange skin .
525 yeah , thats really the big problem facing america right now .
526 other source : breitbart negotiating deal with the honorable bill o'reilly
527 why should i care what doctors want when i can care about the opinion of insurance lobbyists ?
528 china ca n't defend itself from your air carrier attack if it thinks your carrier is in north korea !
529 give this guy his participation trophy , after 8+million spent , he 's earned it !
530 i know right , america will vote that black guy into office for 8 years but become racist as fuck when a crazy white bitch runs for office
531 so sad no one was there to see it
532 thanks for the confirmation .
533 wow typical leftist garbage !
534 `` why did you hate trump so much , he 's governing as a moderate ''
535 thanks for the quality and informative news piece !
536 bear in mind guys , he only spent 5 months on trump 's team , so his role in the campaign was quite limited .
537 is this the kind of world ; the putin-trump thug world , that we want to live in ?
538 maybe they should stop doing illegal shit .
539 but your welcome to have dinner and take instagram photos of him at mar a lago .
540 except to pay protestors
541 if fox news says it , the opposite is true , keep resisting !
542 ted rules
543 sounds legit .
544 good idea , because people getting sick is what makes insurance expensive .
545 well yeah , gas turbine plants are far more efficient and can easily adujust their production to match the need beyond the baseline nuclear output and growing solar and wind production .
546 more like a group effort
547 their smear campaign against him is that he gives out tons of free money and has developed super potent weed lol .
548 was n't it once part of china , too ?
549 shows what you know , kenya is in africa !
550 he ca n't create the report while he is being audited .
551 his eloquence and mastery of verbiage gives me tingles and wood
552 so is this good or bad ?
553 you forgot `` russian ally and propagandist '' .
554 truly : a meeting of our greatest minds .
555 yes .
556 it 's amazing that this super way-out-there on the fringe issue gets so much attention .
557 this is why you lost
558 he would be happy to match the standards but unfortunately his accomplishments are under audit .
559 but but but mexico is going to pay for it !
560 its a good thing republicans in congress made sure we have a good mental health system , so we can catch thjngs like this early .
561 trump has supporters because he said he was going to accomplish great things ... why are there still trump supporters ?
562 `` i hire the best guys ''
563 that 's $ 333 per venezuelan , where the money would be a lot more useful .
564 no , just individual legislatures .
565 rest easy as i need my pool cleaned .... then i will kick you out .
566 that judge sitting on that island out in the middle of the pacific ocean is now manipulating other judges .
567 potential ?
568 well at least he 's not black and golfing
569 it 's always projection in gopadelphia
570 with all of the illegal immigrants we should be mexicos government
571 when can we impeach the orange buffoon already ?
572 what better place to hide it in plain sight than the hands of our enemies ?
573 you really pissed president bannon off did n't you donnie ?
574 he barely knew the guy .
575 i 'm starting to think trump is an idiot .
576 he was way too brown
577 she should respond that she did n't mention jesus because she knew he was busy since he could n't make it to the white house the other day but that she probably should have at least name dropped jesus ' surrogates here on earth : ted nugent and kid rock .
578 jeffrey sessions is the name of someone who seshes brah
579 that 's a poll of 677 registered voters ... i would hardly say we can make claims of `` nearly half of americans '' with such a small sample size as they can be very misleading
580 `` who could 've thought the climate is so complicated '' ....
581 i do n't know if they 're intentionally trying to invent they 're own reality hoping we 'll believe it , or if they 're all just so fucking stupid .
582 most of the government is immoral , expensive , and unwise .
583 every time trump demands funding from congress for his silly wall , democrats need to remind the president that their refusal helps him keep the promise he made to the american people during his campaign .
584 i 'm shocked !
585 i 'm so glad policy decisions do n't necessarily rely on popularity .
586 more `` fake news '' .
587 trump will be releasing his new book '100 day of winning '
588 shocking .
589 i 'm sure americans as a whole will love this bill .
590 he ai n't wrong .
591 i thought the lesson learned was that we needed less epa ?
592 it 's almost like the whole trump-russia thing is hot bologna .
593 schiff must save us all .
594 obviously , the inner workings of a mind like donald 's are far too complex for us common folk to comprehend , just like his tax returns
595 i 'm glad he is following what he said in his letter .
596 this will surely be the end for drumf !
597 duh , why would they need to set aside any funding when mexico 's going to pay for it ?
598 until a foreign entity sways another election in the opposite direction -- then they 'll be ready to drop nuclear bombs .
599 what about the white genocide his supporters say liberals are doing ?
600 mexico is a country , not a race .
601 so , clueless about this next impending disaster too .
602 but but but i thought that people were leaving her in droves because she would n't stop talking about russia !
603 disappointing .
604 lies just like her dad .
605 totally the actions of people who are n't super-guilty .
606 send him to the gulag .
607 how is this not doxxing ?
608 lock him up .
609 b-b-but trickle down , it has to work , just give it another 100 years , i 'm sure it will make maga !
610 oh boy , i sure hope all of the people who spend their life work trashing tulsi gabbard get in here and denigrate the names of these traitors who clearly have a russian pro-assad conspiracy they 're involved in .
611 that is an estimated amount , i 'm sure his criminal organization will hand over all their assets , let 's send crux down to collect .
612 ohhhhh trumpy is going to be grumpy about that .
613 it 's not like anyone cares what millenials think though , amirite ?
614 yeah , canada that notorious threat to the worlds
615 liberal tears
616 i ca n't imagine the current wh trying to cover something up .
617 trump is winning !
618 if only obama had n't called macron , surely 1.7 million people would have switched their votes .
619 but the polio vaccine causes autism so it is a good thing .
620 trump to be paid $ 3million/year for renting space in trump tower to the secret service .
621 libs so butthutt , love it
622 yea but those poor corporations * really * want to develop that land , why wo n't anything think about them ?
623 every thumbnail of this fucks face is more punchable than the last .
624 oops , was that not supposed to be shared ?
625 i 'm sure there is nothing noteworthy to be found in them , since they 're being audited and such
626 ca n't come soon enough , damn obamacare for the internet needed to go away
627 he seems intent on making america a dictatorship .. i 'm not sure if it 's because he wants to be a dictator , or because he 's a spoiled child who just wants to get his own way .
628 if only
629 `` the adults on the continent were talking , and i just felt so intimidated . ''
630 bernie^would^have^won^big^ly
631 oh , i 'm sure this is going to put him on their best side .
632 if you ignore the fact that he lost , then sure .
633 in an ideal world , politicians that say stuff like this would be purged .
634 you miss 100 % of the shots you do n't take !
635 yay , fascists !
636 a medieval solution to a non-existent problem .
637 lol at the people thinking this is hypocritical .
638 with how demented some on the left have become when it comes to president trump , better safe than sorry .
639 when did obama ever say that he was n't a capitalist ?
640 and jill stein lost for the exact same reason .
641 well he has n't even opened up the plantations for them to pick cotton yet .
642 maybe we could just get him an x-box or something and he could live out his war game apocalypse fantasies that way instead of in real life .
643 to be fair to trump and sean sphincter , it 's totes obama 's fault that the guy he fired in 2014 was trump 's national security advisor and trump did n't even make him go through the security clearance process .
644 shocking
645 still not cruel enough for ya , gop ?
646 but emails
647 you mean working for a living , who knew ?
648 * putin mislead me - he said being president would be like being on the apprentice but even better *
649 have you found any yet ?
650 funniest thing is that this guy was n't even expecting to win and the dems could n't find someone to beat him .
651 thanks obama !
652 in a continuing abdication of all adult responsibility , republicans will just blame obama
653 still more than obama created !
654 jesus , so do i .
655 easier to cut jobs that have n't been filled i guess
656 the west coast is already preparing for war in courts to prevent drilling in the pacific .
657 of course everyone knows being poor means god hates you
658 i guess obama could start a university to get some cash ... worked out well for trump
659 well there 's democrats , third party voters , and 4 % of republicans .
660 but do n't call him a racist !
661 what a fucking dumbuck ... america is doomed if he is n't going to be impeached .
662 that sounds legal
663 how is this related to politics ?
664 `` pence names anti-choice activist to top health care job '' fify
665 experts predicted something wrong about trump , therefore , everything they say should be disregarded
666 * i need to become crowned king quick before the dementia totally overtakes me and i wo n't even be able to appreciate it anymore *
667 `` look , there are thousands of kids that were born 100 days ago ... look at what they have accomplished and look at what i have accomplished in those 100 days ... i might be the most successful baby in the history of america ! ''
668 fucking propaganda lol
669 the south park guys came to the same conclusion : he is fucking impossible to parody .
670 did n't the obama administration write that thing ?
671 fucking dirty dopers should just take xanax or k-pins like a good american
672 but wouldnt it be better if those 41 million people just lifted themselves up by their bootstraps ?
673 ... if you can afford $ 26,000 per year in premiums .
674 how about they do n't fund stuff on a state level ... let people fund what they want
675 i bet you a coke trump has vested interests in the philippines .
676 man compared to these guys bush seems downright reasonable .
677 also : this toast is stale !
678 right to bear arms is not only for hunting animals .
679 why are n't our buddies , the saudis , doing this for us ?
680 i 'm waiting for the invisible hand of the free market to clean up this mess .
681 did someone explain to m brownshirt what fema stands for and what they are supposed to do yet ?
682 fuck , obama is an affable guy .
683 al fraken is taking over reddit
684 token ag says what ?
685 i 'm glad dc and la politicians have such well-run cities that they can meddle in the affairs of other states .
686 well looks like he only has the `` invest in gold because the government is scary '' and `` colloidal silver cures everything '' commercials left .
687 shocker !
688 drill , baby , drill .
689 i raffle , i ruse ?
690 we all know the economy was crashed by soaring tax rates and over regulation !

695 not a republican , but most dems i know are uneducated when it pertains to the constitution , diplomacy and economics .
696 all we need is this one last hit , then we can quit .
697 i must say that i am very surprised by this .
698 awww yeahhh i love being from texas we do n't give a fuck
699 he lies !
700 she still needs that signed permission slip from her parents before the school of hard knocks will allow her to go on her presidential field trip .
701 that 's because both parties are exactly the same .
702 so when do we invade iran ?
703 he 's really popular with the intellectuals here in america as well .
704 it 's more like obama is better for * * his * * business .
705 maybe a stupid question : have we seen obama 's tax returns ?
706 good , i was worried all weekend because of this .
707 just think of all the jobs he will create with that tax break .
708 and i thought reddit hated him before ...
709 they are just putting all those subsidies to good use
710 yet , my atheist self could not volunteer for my son 's troop .
711 you have to be a special kind of stupid to believe the government creates jobs .

715 in fact he married six or seven of them .
716 and that 's why he is the food stamp president .
717 israel tried to do this with the uss liberty in the 1970 's , luckily it failed , but it showed the lengths israel is willing to go to get its way
718 why ca n't we teach both theories and kids can decide for themselves ?
719 me too and shamefully i am a registered republican .. that will be voting again for obama !
720 how do we get this on the mainstream media ?
721 maybe she 'll move out of the country .
722 of course the black guy is cracking down on slavery .
723 here 's the translation : `` if you make lots of money , you will pay less taxes ... if you make less money and barely get by , living paycheck to paycheck , you will pay more taxes. ``
724 they 've essentially looted the entire country
725 it 's not about balancing the budget .
726 'murica !

734 the next thing you now we will have a corporate theocrat in the white house and a massive homeland attack .
735 if the clueless idiots running john mccain 's presidential campaign had bothered to do their homework before thrusting this moron into the public spotlight , we would n't be making her rich and acting like anything she has to say is worth the time to listen .

744 democrats to open office of personnel to constantly ask rand paul whether he thinks private businesses should be able to discriminate against blacks .

770 so has the war against poverty and we keep giving the poor cash .
771 why has n't he resigned ?
772 yeah that 'll get passed by congress for sure .
773 great , more taking from those that work the hardest and giving to those that cry the loudest .
774 damn librul media is picking on bobby !
775 lol ....... douche bags
776 too easy , why bother .
777 oh , there for a minute i thought kansas was done for .
778 i have a baaaaad feeling about this chewy
779 yeah , but it creates a ton of jobs .
780 mccain and reality have n't been on speaking terms since 2000 .
781 is there a good list of all the legislation that the gop filibustered over the last 6 years ?
782 so , for tea partiers at least incompetence works .
783 this `` brilliant '' mathematician and economist just announced cutting the u w system by 300 million .
784 god damn these women and their sex-having !
785 but i thought he hates the military ?
786 these kids need jobs .
787 says the guy who illegally stole his seat of office .
788 nope .
789 it would be amusing to also apply to all government workers , being that they are paid with tax payer money and that is the real issue here , is n't it ?
790 so are churches and parliament buildings , no use really
791 i 'm sure that crashing the global economy , using taxpayer money to bail out the rich , and papering over the financial collapse with zero interest rates and quantitative easing had * nothing * to do with this .
792 ftfy : muslim centrist
793 we did it reddit !
794 one thing i can agree with ron paul on .
795 and they say manufacturing in the us is dead .
796 so its being reported by `` info wars '' so you know it must be true .
797 did any of us expect sanders to win the south ?
798 surely it was bill clinton 's antics that turned the tide
799 i 'll miss him
800 well , slap another 30 or so delegates into her column .
801 truuuu
802 but still no transcripts from her goldman-sachs speeches .
803 maybe if we get 45,000 signatures on a petition , we can make it happen .
804 well , when you have some liberals salivating about nominating a liberal judge and overturning all the 5 - 4 gun laws , you can see why some people want to block obama from doing that .
805 so cnn just gave 50 minutes of uninterrupted air time to donald trump because of romney 's speech .
806 he meant to beg , if anyone of you are thinking bj thats on you .
807 i 'm sure the commish does n't get a dime directly or indirectly from comcast .
808 i love sanders and everything he believes in but i think his policy 's wo n't make it into or out of congress .
809 she 's playing it safe after her foul play on super tuesday .
810 must of been a hell of a hacker .
811 donald trumps voting record is clean .. and free of any voting record .
812 `` fiscal conservative ''
813 does n't she already have enough ?
814 i 'm willing to bet most jobs on average are going to be on the lower end of the bell curve .
815 i fucking said it when bernie said he 'd show up that she 'd attend too .
816 the amount of negativity here is massive .
817 rubio = tpp and gang of 8 .... yeah real conservatism
818 i pledge allegiance to the donald and to the trumpublic for which he stands .
819 but he can still get the nomination !
820 and it was illegal .
821 good show , luckily they just released the first season on netflix !
822 yeah the guy who wants to start a war with russia is totally sane
823 in all seriousness the clinton campaign should consider gaffes like this if they 're going with him as vp .
824 downvote for having insufferable redirect ads that do n't even let you read the fucking article .
825 there is a double-standard that says it is okay to be forceful like that to man , but not to a woman .
826 cnn has certainly outdone itself .
827 but she is a women and has the right to talk , he is a man and should be silent .
828 -- -- -- -- -spin stops here -- -- -- -- -- --
829 a neutered republican party is just what this country needs .
830 downvoting reality
831 but sjw 's and bs supporters have said that is racist .
832 i personally think tv would be awesome if everyone was going on the air with no idea what was going to happen next .
833 hahaha and i 'm sure the numbers will be totally accurate
834 because unions will totally go for someone who claims american wages are too high
835 `` ... ( the resolution ) would * * steel * * need to pass the legislature ... '' you 're fuckin up again , buzzfeed .
836 pretty awful attempt at `` satire '' or , alternatively , purposeful muddying of the water .
837 her lead increased by about 10 % today .
838 yeah , i would much rather have trump or cruz !
839 oh , that 'll help
840 yeah , fuck this .
841 why can people not see that cruz is a lot scarier than trump ?
842 every single post on the front page is either pro-bernie or anit-hillary ( minus the few neutral ones that slipped through ) , there really has n't been any doubt for a while now .
843 o'malley is going to reopen his candidacy just for the 50k
844 hungry people dont stay hungry for long .
845 like previous attempts to suggest bernie is racist and sexist ?
846 man , that upset me more than it should
847 i 'm sure they were just talking about tea and crumpets , right .
848 yes , please make public universities as successful as public high schools .
849 that is the type of president the us needs a caring and loving abuela .
850 i think people who choose to live in lincoln nebraska lack the imagination to be depressed .
851 yes , because decreasing the amount of money in the average person 's pockets is sure to increase demand .
852 ... complains about long wait times for room service delivery .
853 wow , when i was 8i did n't understand anything about politics .. good for this kid to not be influenced by their parents
854 yeah i mean if people do n't like what a party is about you 'd think they 'd leave or something and go to one that aligns with their views better .
855 human rights campaign say anything ?
856 she just evolved on it .
857 illegal immigrants are not allowed to vote anyways .
858 ... so far .
859 a young brother 's got it bad cus he 's brown ?
860 far from a trump supporter but bernie should get grilled about this it was mostly bernie bros out there
861 he 's within his rights to do so just as much as protestors are within their rights to ~~throw him out~~ make him unilaterally decide to cancel his own events .
862 right and the game against hillary has been squeaky clean too
863 look at all these horrible bigoted racist trump supporters !
864 who is this guy ?
865 america 's best and brightest were definitely not in that stream of trump supporters .
866 it 's k , she get still get things done .
867 disagree , clearly liberals and democrats like these violent tactics
868 this implied threat is exactly the reason why people more prone to violence from all sides will be more likely to be drawn to trump rallies .
869 you know trump is a billionaire , he could be paying people to go after him and make it look like he 's under attack to bolster his fan base .
870 agreed
871 joe did a great job stumping for mccain , i 'm sure trump is pumped about this endorsement
872 then do we need gun laws , or do we really need some breeding restrictions ?
873 yes .
874 translation : `` the people need to stay out of politics and leave it to the corporate elite ! ''
875 yes , i 'm sure a couple lame ddos attempts on his website will completely dismantle him , just like tearing down campaign flyers dismantled campaigns before the internet .
876 of course he feels this way , he 's just glad he 's alive
877 they are n't part of the `` true faith '' .
878 i know , thank god trump will bring some decency back to the gop
879 finally , someone has the courage to stand up to those cookie-peddling lesbos !
880 now i am positive he has brain damage .
881 tldr- homie has a pension he earned as a public servant
882 ah the all important single issue clay aiken vote ...
883 i 've not been a fan of some of the sanders supporters ( i 'm more inclined to support sanders - australian here ) but some of the gloating that 's going on is pretty poor .
884 so basically three ties .
885 yea but he 's still the most electable candidate !
886 because the second most favored candidate amongst black voters is donald trump
887 trump isnt bringing freedom
888 33 % of bernie supporters did not vote for bernie , either .
889 but do n't vote for trump because he never talks about the fact that `` big american corporations no longer make many products in the united states '' .
890 oh no what a shame we really needed another boring debate
891 technically , a barking female dog is a bitch .
892 good thing , because all i want to know is what trump is saying/repeating .
893 this has n't happened before .
894 but i heard he 's the most antigun human to ever walk the earth
895 yep the 1 % is shaking in their boots
896 * cough * anti-second amendment judge * cough *
897 how else is he going make sure his audience understand ?
898 yeah , i trust her national security policy .
899 come on now , what are you gon na do , declare war on another country and not upgrade your nuclear arsenal ?
900 well that sounds about right .
901 what does this have to do with bernie sanders ?
902 we were told that he is a far left ideologue , shocked that he 's not .
903 if only we had compulsory voting bernie would be president .
904 both of them are called 'literally ' hitler , both of them are being called racists , both of them are being called sexists !
905 hey do n't forget about the blacks voting against their interest
906 he should have said , could n't .
907 oh sure , cause god forbid our politicians do n't jump when israel asks .
908 here we go again .
909 but this sub led me to believe only republicans rig elections
910 sure , yeah protest all you want right just do it over there in the back where nobody can see you .
911 well that will help save some money to pay for his tax plan
912 yes , trump would not be a leading candidate if this was a 1st world country .
913 til the best way to increase economic development is to pull funding from educational programs
914 who is this kasich guy i keep hearing about ?
915 nice , objective source there .
916 if dems were n't harsh on gun stuff i wonder what mcconnell would have replaced `` nra approval '' with ?
917 maybe in addition to the cleveland police , they can get reenforcements from chicago , baltimore and phoenix ?
918 and they 're going to start losing jobs to colorado which is going to benefit greatly from the extra tax money brought in through sales of weed .
919 it takes real balls to be a man of conviction in politics
920 he must be anti-semetic
921 so ... we 're going to ignore that the u6 exists ?
922 yay warcrimes !
923 bernie 'whites do n't know what it 's like to be poor ' sanders totally does n't pander .
924 news at 11 : old man has diarrhea .
925 good luck with an energy sink attached to you , ted .
926 this was not a politically smart move .
927 this is just : the gop establishment has asked all muslims in america to begin wearing a special symbol on their clothing so they can be easily identified in public .
928 but they want to kill us all , obummer !
929 yeah cause syria was such great work
930 trump 2016
931 they were great at that in wwii
932 how the fuck is this not `` respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' please explain to me what mental gymnastics explain this blatant misunderstanding of the constitution .
933 can you seriously not understand the difference between a public forum ( which has no prerogative to be neutral ) , to the media which was established on the very concept that it was supposed to be neutral ?
934 # 6 - because donald trump will make a great president .
935 oh , i certainly do .
936 what could possibly go wrong ?
937 probably because even danny devito is personally registering voters
938 presidents are selected , not elected
939 guys its only been an hour maybe it will make it to the front page
940 i hope so
941 color me srprised
942 is there some way we can check people 's blood for junk food and/or steak as well ?
943 `` omg can we stop with the bernie posts ? ''
944 there have been very few if any .
945 hey man women are the primary victims of war , so if one wants to lead us into war , i 'll follow .
946 the imperial president strikes again .
947 in the related news , donald trump ruled out releasing the exact measurements of his dick only saying that `` i guarantee there is no problem , ok ? ''
948 surely the cost of living wont go up ?
949 this is worse than endorsing hillary .. ugh
950 clinton has been asking to be interviewed for months now .
951 well , $ 500 tickets were n't costly enough to keep out the super predators .
952 that 's because females under 65 are `` berniebros ''
953 nothing to see here folks formal interviews are common in security review procedure .
954 no potential for conflict of interest in this practice .
955 sell more state land .
956 it 's cool though because it 's only temporary .
957 # tonedownforwhat
958 maybe if i 'm an asshole they 'll come to my side !
959 fauxminism ?
960 clinton sounds like a sore loser
961 economists are well known as extremely accurate election pickers .
962 right because that 's the same as this
963 jesus fucking christ she 's soft .
964 lol like the corrupt corporate structure is going to do anything for the greater good .
965 because he is the future .
966 gary johnson for president !
967 whatever ! .... as long as 'whitey ' gets the blame !
968 you have no idea what you are saying i can tell you are just repeating what others say just to join the herd
969 yay , democracy .
970 redistribute the air time !
971 i am sure all the berniebros know more about the situation on the border than these guys though .
972 karl marx died in 1883 .
973 donald trump finally takes the conservative vision for abortion to its logical conclusion and all the other cuckservitives that are cucks for obama are saying they do n't want punishment in the event they broke a law .
974 do n't forget to vote for hrc if she gets the nomination
975 yes , the guy who has a 100 % pro-choice record is dismissive of women 's rights
976 mmm , mush .
977 let me think how did it go for the last blue eyed blond hair person to blame there problems on a jewish person
978 i demand an apology to all those poor nazis !
979 with science !
980 i bet they 're shaking in their boots and wo n't dare break the law again !
981 seizing dividends is a great idea to stabilize the market .
982 yes , we ca n't blame the leader of our government for any government involvement with prevention or cleanup of this catastrophe ... because there was no government involvement .
983 uhm , idiots ... the ruling stated that it was not intentional .
984 b .. b .. but both parties are the same , i 'm sure democrats do the same thing all the time
985 the only book you need is the bible
986 statists are mandators , not dictators and there is a hell of a big difference in those two things .
987 suddenly you realize people are crazy .
988 to be fair if we are not going to call the sunsetting of the bush tax cuts an increase , then why should we call this temporary reduction sunsetting an increase ?
989 thanks , obama .
990 i heard this guy is french !
991 at least 8 , because that 's how long it took to make it .
992 a project of the * * tea party patriots * * ... agenda , much ?
993 wisconsin republicans on the other hand , keep the hell away from the ballots !
994 those were n't companies they were people .
995 wow , usa is turing into africa
996 well , both are unreasonable , extreme right wing blowhards that get more credit than they deserve .
997 but , but , millions of people are employed by the fracking oil and gas industry .
998 there 's a reason florida gets its own tag on fark .
999 hey man , at least they do n't have big government breathing down their necks .
1000 oooo , i love political articles where the author knows zilch about the politics they are discussing .
1001 see , the rich are job creators .
1002 if warren buffet is complaining that he has too much money why does n't he just donate it to charity ?
1003 oh , but do n't forget , the dnc and gop are * identical * .
1004 what goes around comes around .
1005 unions did wonders for detroit ... more of that
1006 i 'll take his job and salary if he does n't want it , that is a lot of money imo
1007 love the title
1008 what if one dislikes the polices of both men ?
1009 the obama administration in put out blatant lies as fact -- ignoring any questions or complexity -- and spun the story when it broke ( and most people will only pay attention to the story and its details then ) .
1010 ladies and gentlemen , my new employer .
1011 a small price to pay for freedom ( tm ) .
1012 that 's working well , huh ?
1013 i could n't understand anything juan williams was saying over hannity 's whining .
1014 does n't help the fact that many people consider birth control possibly abortive .
1015 mitt : i am not cutting taxes so people will have more money .
1016 who would have guessed goldman sachs was a liberal spy sent to infiltrate wall street !
1017 romney : `` see , now that i won the debate , employers are now excited about my upcoming victory and are hiring again ! ''
1018 i 'm guessing they think romney is just doing damage control to conceal the `` hard truth '' of the moochers in this country .
1019 can we stop bashing the job-creators here ?
1020 oh ..... that 's ok because both parties are the same .
1021 how can something that is undefined possibly be impossible ?
1022 yeah that stammering sure was annoying .
1023 is this supposed to be surprising news ?
1024 surely kurt cobain was the only person to look at an ultrasound and conclude the person in it looked like a bean .
1025 he is obviously the anti-christ
1026 got your tweezers handy ?
1027 if they do n't like it they can just go work elsewhere .
1028 bullies
1029 9/11 changed everything .
1030 i said it in another thread- those found guilty of either tampering with election results or with voter registration should face capital punishment .
1031 i 'm ok with spending money to ensure children do n't starve , reducing the risk of homelessness , and providng access to healthcare for the elderly and low income families .
1032 when are the republicans going to be charged for being the nation 's largest orgainized crime group ?
1033 it is a vast left-wing conspiracy .
1034 `` i can see syria from my front porch , it is iran 's path to the sea ''
1035 maybe with a romney presidency we will get a deuce bigalow 3 .
1036 earth-shattering .
1037 yea , he 's had such a positive effect but unemployment is 2+ percentage points that he promised it would be ... just keep up that positive attitude though !
1038 oooh yeah , he has shown himself to be really committed to this !
1039 politician claims to speak for god , seems legit
1040 are any/all of these up for election this season ?
1041 just imagine the support he could have had if he had showed up orange in a sombrero !
1042 annnd he could have bought insurance beforehand instead of having the choice between between getting rescued or bankrupt .
1043 poor al .... nobody outside of the hardcore huffpo crowd takes him seriously anymore ....
1044 credit unions anyone ?
1045 no shit .. really ?
1046 it 's their own fault for being lazy takers , they need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and turn themselves into makers !
1047 it 's a good thing then that existing laws do n't expire or we would be completely lawless !
1048 obviously he just wants to prevent the children from becoming dependents and learn to pull themselves up by their bootstraps so that they can buy their own christmas gifts .
1049 clearly a racist .
1050 the alabama economy tanked long before * obama cared * .
1051 seems legit
1052 if we eliminate entitlements and they buy their own money poverty will disappear !
1053 that 's where the nsa comes in .
1054 a good first step .
1055 ca n't be any more dysfunctional .
1056 thanks , tea party !
1057 why do n't socialists want to be hungry ?
1058 they must have worked really really hard .
1059 leave these job creators alone !
1060 cause if it ai n't white and christian it just ai n't right ya 'll
1061 it says study in the title it must be true
1062 typical socialists
1063 was this a secret ?
1064 i feel safer now
1065 just disgusting .
1066 but that 's the job of a courtier , dontchya know .
1067 or do n't care as long as they have food on their hands and sports in front of them .
1068 not nearly enough .
1069 do n't fret citizen , the free market sorts this type of thing out .
1070 obviously , we should impeach him .
1071 he 's not as good as colbert .
1072 your move , california .
1073 yes , and if a black person wants to marry a white person , they can go to another state !
1074 both parties are the same
1075 damn man too bad you ca n't do anything about that
1076 well that 's not a corrupt decision in the least bit .
1077 i love how `` state 's rights '' conservatives are waging this war .
1078 where i look for advice on economics !
1079 classify science as a foreign language , pass legislation requiring only english language documents will be considered by congress .
1080 the koch brothers can suck my dick
1081 in the spirit of transparency , i will be grossly unprofessional with my former clients ' personal information .
1082 the republican party is two parties that hate each other , almost as much as they hate democrats , banding together to secure the `` majority '' and keep the actual majority from running the country .
1083 we ca n't afford to pay workers enough to pay us .
1084 \ # gopfiscalresponsibility ^^
1085 well if the kids had given him more lobby dollars he might have done something for them but those cheapskates ignored him .
1086 that will certainly help them in elections .
1087 he got the coveted kkk vote
1088 the us is just an inherently more violent place , just look at our track record .
1089 job creators should have the freedom not to pay their employes if their they are not worth the overtime .
1090 i do n't actually know the religious mix of congress , but i would suspect it 's mostly made up of non-catholic christians and thus do n't follow the pope 's teachings anyway .
1091 bsmsnbc
1092 followed by the `` jesus hold my beer act '' .
1093 yes and since schools have to be integrated , let 's get rid of those .
1094 how can it be legal as a political figure to send an e-mail blast that is full of such patently false information ?
1095 it must suck to be a republican in 2015 , in fact the last 20 years or so must have been tough for any moderate gop .
1096 dammit south dakota , this is why no one likes us .
1097 yeah , give it to the party with real female leaders like palin and bachmann !
1098 damn busybodies .
1099 the first one being jeb bush campaigning for president .
1100 yeah , like fox cares about honesty .
1101 but remember folks ... the gop is n't bigoted , and certainly care about the rights people !
1102 people of wis need to wake up pronto !
1103 why do we not have some qualifications to run for president ?
1104 he 's been drinking too much of that flouridated water i tell you !
1105 from what i hear , you 've been using your bill papers for rolling doobies .
1106 i 'm glad she 's brave enough to speak for the middleclass , but i have my reservations something * meaningful * will come of it .
1107 wow the incompetence is staggering it seems like as long as the gop chants no new taxes they can get away with anything .
1108 lies !
1109 they 're all scared of ernie chambers .
1110 the `` states ' rights '' candidate .
1111 they both are the same .
1112 hillary 's campaign travels halfway around the world before bernie 's puts its shoes on
1113 good god i hope they live in the south .
1114 hillary ?
1115 the reporter who published this was abruptly fired from cnn for publishing a `` racist , bigoted '' story .
1116 i 'm sure this will only help her campaign .
1117 yeah dont they always
1118 well , you changed my vote with 12 seconds of an interview
1119 someone should ask judge judy what she thinks .
1120 `` debacle '' makes it sound like it was n't intentional .
1121 great timing new york state
1122 you could give a whale a behind-the-back handjob with this reach
1123 do n't deny the queen her rightful throne !
1124 nope !
1125 remember all the people that died and that nobody went to jail .
1126 noooo waaaaaay
1127 he 'll have it sorted out once he 's president .
1128 atleast chelsea clinton stays on message
1129 no reason to hide your motives when people ca n't vote against it anymore .
1130 hillary will offer sanders the cuban ambassadorship and all you fuckers will fall in line .
1131 wait so that means he should just concede now right ?
1132 yahoo is so rightwing these days .
1133 uhhhh has she never looked up and seen them ?
1134 she 's just another uninformed bernie bro .
1135 obama has n't apologized so why should bernie ?
1136 this probably cost us several thousand dollars in security so she could go on the `` proletariat parade '' .
1137 blistering slam
1138 well , this is certainly a deal breaker !
1139 oh look at bernie discovering issues about a state he does n't already live in , how cute
1140 when someone shows you who they are believe them .
1141 which would n't be an issue if she was so otherwise transparent of course .
1142 nice job guys , real awesome revolution youre starting here .
1143 what a hack .
1144 apparently she prays multiple times a day , so i just do n't see why the pope picked a socialist jew over her .
1145 how dare the government does n't have the right to restrict political videos from being aired !
1146 sounds we like we have too many goddamn laws .
1147 who 's paying them ?
1148 glad to see reddit going towards cosmopolitan for its political articles
1149 at least this time it was n't an airport bathroom or with rent-a-boy prostitutes
1150 `` a bernie sanders presidential campaign event in new york reached a tense ending saturday as a man shouted questions about sanders 's religion over boos from the audience. ``
1151 more taxes is the clear solution .
1152 he 's not a jew , he 's a muslim-lover !
1153 remember young voters are uniformed idiots , unless they are voting for trump or hilary .
1154 when my wife was 19 and in college ( late 60s early 70s ) her doctor would not prescribe birth control pills to her unless she was married .
1155 damn , do they have any more adjectives for the title ?
1156 if we downvote this hard enough it wo n't be true # feelthebern
1157 that indictment 's coming any day now , right guys ?
1158 you dropped this :
1159 i 'm sure hillary really misses her .
1160 he 's complaining about constituents reaching out to their elected representatives ?
1161 we need to make this a 'in your face ' election issue .
1162 superdelegates are the most democratic thing i 've ever heard of
1163 makes me feel so much better about being called 'petulant ' by paul krugman for not wanting to unite behind hillary clinton
1164 to be fair , you do as she says not as she does .
1165 nominate hillary at your own peril .
1166 shocked that this thread is down voted so much .
1167 good thing superdelegates are the ones really in charge then !
1168 judges have made it clear with obama that they 're ok with a non-american president
1169 no no she later added per capita at the end of her statement a few days later so its ok now .
1170 of course he says that , he 's a white male .
1171 because clinton voter are in general a little `` special '' .
1172 this is n't democracy dammit .
1173 if only there were two hillarys to split the vote .
1174 why so snarky ?
1175 in the panel discussion after the debate one of the women complained about his tone .
1176 he 'll look into it .
1177 relevant article , credible news source
1178 this is so sexist
1179 well , she has my vote now .
1180 well , at least hillary 's wall street speeches are now publicly available .
1181 man , what a fuck up that guy is .
1182 ya ; because 2015 will be the year that scrooge mcbernie spent raking in millions from lobbyists , creating offshore shell companies and lighting cigars with hundred dollar bills .
1183 oh dear god ... it gets worse : multiple souces confirm cars may have also been involved in the trip .
1184 must have been nice for the pope to finally meet his boss in person .
1185 here 's your reply
1186 banjo sales through the roof !
1187 the kind of guts it takes to be a president .
1188 widely fabricated and subjective information .
1189 that would be sexist and would suggest that she 's talking too much because she 's a woman .
1190 this is so democratic !
1191 that 's like 30 per state , i do n't know how our infrastructure and economy will sustain it .
1192 they expect to get more of someone else 's money of course .
1193 this is functionally equivalent to sucker punching a guy who 's actively leaving an event in the face .
1194 i never lie .
1195 so make it illegal .
1196 well , duh , obama is pretty hard right !
1197 this article is ridiculous , but voting records in a republican-dominated government is not a good gauge on how liberal someone is .
1198 yes but also the only true liberal .
1199 on foreign policy , clinton is no moderate .
1200 it will continue to fall , but she will still get the nomination due to name recognition .
1201 hillary would overthrow any government as long as there was a business interest .
1202 surely this will affect the polling numbers .
1203 this , of course assumes the highly unlikely outcome of bernie sanders losing the primary .
1204 whitest arrest ever
1205 how will clinton come back from this ?
1206 thanks for the insightful article as always salon
1207 show me the quid pro quo !
1208 so what ?
1209 lmao voter fraud allegation predictions were right on the money .
1210 drumpf is big government of a different variety , though .
1211 he 'll tell them to cut it out .
1212 well it looks like another failed attempt at socialism ... maybe if you try it in america it will work better
1213 you do n't say
1214 really , this should have been an obvious win given how new york is a southern state .
1215 welcome to the apocalypse , people .
1216 and i 'm sure it was fair and square
1217 wow what a surprise
1218 yes , but hillary won majority of the voters in ny .
1219 it 's over guys , wrap it up and kneel before the queen .
1220 seems fair
1221 what 's wrong with andrew jackson ?
1222 fourth amendment ?
1223 thanks for waiting until after new york to say this
1224 and everyone knows the best way to encourage people to join your side is to lecture them about what you perceive as their faults
1225 he says this , but does actually think hillary would have gotten those votes ?
1226 stein/bernie 2016
1227 so then they vote again right ?
1228 come on guys , lucy flores is n't a real democrat , bernie does n't support down ballot democrats .
1229 okay well he 's worth a lot still
1230 but only people who are n't employed and are looking for free handouts support bernie .
1231 hrc supporter here : it 's * adorable *
1232 how much did clinton pay you for that one ?
1233 we do n't need 23 types of comments when children are going hungry in this country !
1234 guns keep america safe once again .
1235 go after the superiors too .
1236 the only reason she and her peers are so adamant about gun control is that they know when the people have had enough , they 'll be the first assholes dragged to the guillotine .
1237 i like to think that the government had absolutely nothing to do with it and now theyre like `` well fuck now they think we did it ... ''
1238 he knows a compliant republican when he buys one .
1239 the phrasing is great
1240 this wo n't get downvoted .
1241 shocker !
1242 conspiracy !
1243 i do n't know how fb works but would n't fb be responsible for taking down groups without a real reason ?
1244 you should really pick a third party that you 're interested in instead , i believe that if any of them gets 15 % they get public funding and get to participate in future presidential debates
1245 that 'll show her
1246 i look forward to our first native american vice president !
1247 just make sure she does n't vote .
1248 north carolina seems to have its priorities right
1249 it is all going to be cleared up in one week , i promise next week it , whatever the `` it '' is will be delivered and the candidate hillary clinton will be out .
1250 sounds like a good excuse for more gop tax cuts !
1251 the question is , should bernie apologize ?
1252 the calendar is favorable to sanders though
1253 if bernie gave a damn about this country he would concede tonight .
1254 is that with or without super-delegates ?
1255 because bernie supporters are sexist too , right ?
1256 because he was totally going to win it otherwise .
1257 probably an endorsement from the indiana governor .
1258 wonder why drudge report or breitbart have n't reported on this at all today ?
1259 a moral economy is a moral society .
1260 hey look , it 's inquisitr doing another `` hillary did something illegal '' article .
1261 this is hard hitting journalism at it 's finest
1262 do n't worry , i 'm just it was just a mistake like when his campaign was saying carson dropped out and to vote for cruz .
1263 sky is blue ?
1264 `` it 's all his violent rhetoric .... ''
1265 bernie should say he will run as an independent if hillary does n't release the transcripts
1266 im with her !
1267 we named the dog indiana .
1268 i 'm sure this will turn out to be real
1269 seems like chomsky and hersh agree ... if i were the establishment , i would n't worry about it , since they 've never been right before .
1270 did n't mention 32 trillion in offshore money being brought back into the economy and taxed when the loopholes are close .
1271 this does n't support the idea that clinton in unelectable , do n't vote away !
1272 if we knew what everyone 's best interest were , why have elections ?
1273 palin , stalin whats the difference .
1274 when i grow up , i want to have a union job with the state , so i can make people pay me more and have retirement benefits greater than my salary .
1275 if i take them up on this offer does that make me a communist ?
1276 if an average american defaults on a home , it 's because of some moral lacking on their part ; if a rich american defaults on a home , it 's brilliant strategy .
1277 is there any piece of liberal propaganda garbage that redditors do n't vote up ?
1278 clinton was a secret muslim too ?
1279 yup , we elected him to solve all the problems and instead he keeps blaming everyone else for things he inherited .
1280 republican party is such a great political party that every republican should be very very proud .
1281 just so everyone knows , he is really a republican because republicans the only ones who are completely corrupt .
1282 well they are the job creators
1283 yeah well , i 'm sure once he became president he became aware of some new information and so this all makes sense .
1284 wow , i had no idea robert gates was such an awful anti-semite .
1285 how so ?
1286 well ... there it goes ... welcome to communism i guess .... people will really miss their freedoms .
1287 as someone who does n't watch much of the tv news ... are they still all sucking bachmann 's dick , or is she seen as irrelevant now ?
1288 al qadea were guests of the taliban , by islamic tradition and afghani tribal tradition they could n't just `` offer '' bin laden to the us government .
1289 as someone who 's had his balls fondled before a flight , all i can say is : do n't you dare !
1290 how about instead of giving tax breaks to `` job creators '' so they can create jobs , we give tax breaks to `` job creators '' after they create jobs ?
1291 shocking .
1292 guns do n't kill people .
1293 they only thank the soldiers that they can use for political gain .
1294 perfect , you can buy a car and drive over the border into canada and hopefully theyll give you health care
1295 it is a great news for republicans : instead of worrying about the cost of pension , support and health coverage , the soliders sort the problem by themselves !
1296 bill should just take some personal responsibility .
1297 totally dumb , he should only agree to do this if obama shows his dental records to prove he 's not an alien , or something .
1298 four years later and we still hear from palin at least once a week .
1299 fox should have just prayed the hurricane away , then that would really get obama !
1300 i got ta imagine this is definitely making the christmas letter .
1301 in ohio we trust .
1302 just because `` washington '' and wall street both begin with the letter `` w '' does n't mean they are the same entity .
1303 it also states that the machines switched obama for romney ....... looks like the tag line takes the cake though .
1304 ah yes , world net daily , a balanced and sane look at the country 's political climate from people with integrity and an interest in the truth .
1305 your facts and science have no place here .
1306 how can it possibly be that this intelligent , sweet woman * * lives alone * * ?
1307 i do n't understand how this could be , the media kept telling me he was a hack !
1308 yeah rpmnet would never do that
1309 the important thing to remember is that it is wrong to say that racism motivates hatred towards the president , and that the image of a black man hanging is equally not racist .
1310 just so long as the food banks do n't get it , its all good .
1311 socialism !
1312 quality journalism .
1313 great , i know i go out of my way to frequent foodhandling services that do n't offer proper health care to their employees .
1314 damn commie !
1315 no but i 'd like a brochure .
1316 i say we let them secede , bring in the army , then invade .
1317 they have to , because they know in their hearts they should have been aborted .
1318 glenn beck is keepin ' it classy , as always !
1319 is it correct like your election predictions ?
1320 that 's the tipe of aducation them get at their estate label , lol
1321 you lost the election , give it up
1322 i 'm going to miss allen , but at least we still have michele bachmann to laugh at .
1323 because austerity worked so well overseas , of course !
1324 and if the republicans can help him out , then all the better , amiright ?
1325 they want things and stuff and he 's giving it to them !
1326 they should feel honored to be burned to death making cheap shit to be sold by the great walmart corporation !
1327 considering his terrible record of prosecuting people leaking info this is interesting .
1328 well , america showed it does n't care about family , so why should he ?
1329 problem solved .
1330 that 's pretty much all that voted for 'em , so why not ?
1331 how dare the guy that beat romney not offer up romney 's plan !
1332 especially the 40 % that pay no taxes .
1333 only communists believe in public roads .
1334 yeah , because that 's really an emergency .
1335 twist : rnc and donors purchase multiple mercenary groups and take over the country for themselves .
1336 a true patriot .
1337 could the family sue ?
1338 privatizing education is a great idea !
1339 here 's an idea how about we start growing our own food and get off food stamps all together
1340 unsurprisingly , the congressmen responsible are a rogues ' gallery of puppets for the koch criminals .
1341 yes , that 's basically it .
1342 i 'm glad this is getting so much attention ; the whole poison water thing is par for the course in eastern kentucky and no one seems to care .
1343 if only her son had n't married that slut !
1344 police departments get paid by arrests ?
1345 at least 0.01 % are brave enough to stand up and tell the truth about climate change , even if the other 99.99 % are cowards .
1346 but it 's important to increase the record profits of the wealthy so that they can make more jobs !
1347 how about obama using the espionage act to spy on journalists who have been political opponents , is that fair game ?
1348 obviously dianne feinstein is an anti-semite and a racist
1349 they created a bunch of code words associated with the bikini bridgegate , so that they could talk about something important but non-public that happened last week .
1350 so we 're just supposed to let blacks and messicans vote ?
1351 that explains the bloody carnage happening in colorado right now .
1352 in related news : climateviewer loses half its readership in 2013 , now down to two readers .
1353 could they be held legally liable for the deaths that could be shown to be attributable to a lack of insurance but would have been covered under the obamacare they were denied access to
1354 that 's probably because it 's not legal , anywhere in the us
1355 ai n't privatization just grand !
1356 the war part was added by that link , he was saying that the propagandizing of today shares some similarities with the propagandizing of the pre-war nazi 's you dont have to have a bumper sticker `` eat the rich '' to campaign for higher taxes on the wealthy , thats just preaching hate .
1357 spending our way out of recession has been working so well for him .
1358 i wonder how long he will be around before he 's assassinated for all of his good ideas ?
1359 are you saying we should limit a job by gender roles you shitlord .
1360 this idiots inflated ego , will now get popped publicly .
1361 if obama was really concerned about expanding the economy he would n't be trying to pass tpp
1362 quite a few congressmen get these subsidies .
1363 man the gop really knows how to speak to the lower to middle class people .
1364 what is wrong with people ?
1365 not by the oil companies like a good republican ?
1366 giving the republican party or the democrat party the power over government policy guarantees more stupidity , wars , exploitation and oppression
1367 oh gosh , ill bet its a troll .
1368 no one listens to the bitch-ass un any damn way .
1369 jesus , how do we have these sorts of fucking idiots running anything .
1370 great photo op for the gop minority outreach program .
1371 everyone should be thanking the republican senate and congress who are clearly responsible for this dramatic turn in our economy !
1372 surely they will raise the debt ceiling .. we ca n't hurt mcconnell 's economy .
1373 hooray !
1374 yeah because * foster care * will be a better environment for these kids to grow up in than one in which their parents let them walk home from a park alone .
1375 if they ban the word hungry , does that mean we dont have to eat anymore ?
1376 i 'm sure this wo n't be abused in huge quantities .
1377 thanks obama
1378 it 's just what the `` market '' demands to retain their `` talent '' .
1379 and this bright spark somehow earned an officer 's rank in the army ?
1380 because the more you know about something , the more badderer it is .
1381 heh , i wonder why we had to get a minimum wage in the first place .
1382 yeah , who cares if no-one believes the us will stick by it 's word .
1383 `` abortion alternatives '' include building a time machine and going back to warn yourself about your rapist .
1384 itt : dumbass anti-war hippy wimps forgetting about the slumbering threat of warsaw pact armour in the case of a central european invasion !
1385 no more americans should die doing bibi 's bidding .
1386 corporate feudalism is what i call it .
1387 yea the solution to corruption in politics is to reduce free speech .
1388 ted cruz is married to a vice president of goldman sachs
1389 he 's whitish so it 's okay .
1390 sounds like a smaller , less intrusive government to me !
1391 i 'm shocked .
1392 governor rick scott led the way , and never spent a minute in jail for stealing multi millions of taxpayer dollars .
1393 why allow retirement ?
1394 you would think for $ 1.5 million that you can get something better .
1395 if these idiots want war with iran so badly send them in the first wave of infantry .
1396 in gopese this is called `` reaching out to moderates ''
1397 well they did n't say that .
1398 thats discrimination !
1399 she had such success at hp
1400 the pensions are n't the problem , politicians not paying the costs in real time is .
1401 bernie could have won the endorsement of the gay steel maker union , but they 're too establishment for him .
1402 let them eat cake crumbs ... and thanks obama
1403 they should stop expecting handouts and get a job
1404 if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ... oh wait
1405 pff science
1406 clinton +19 in california kek
1407 are blogs allowed or not ?
1408 did n't you guys know it 's just her turn to be president ?
1409 they are n't going to vote for someone that just told them to drop dead , that 's for sure
1410 hillary is kicking them out as fast as she can .
1411 or 15
1412 clinton is a terribly flawed candidate and if the rest of the democratic party establishment has any sense they 'll flip on her as quickly as she flopped on coal .
1413 literally newsmax .
1414 * * election fraud should be in the title of the article not voter fraud , jesus .
1415 that is because cruz 's wife took the hit for him , er , by him .
1416 thats only encouraging them
1417 i 'm sure you understand how conservative women think huffpo
1418 `` nuclear shill '' jesus christ you bros are amazing
1419 hillary in november - `` at least i 'm helping down ticket dems with my donations '' hillary in april - `` down ticket who ? ''
1420 kind of figured it would happen , and ofc they are going to use the `` think of the children '' reasoning .
1421 what do doctors know about economics or public policy ?
1422 it 's a process , step by step , to single-payer .
1423 orange is a baby step to black i guess
1424 y'all motherfuckers need supply side jesus .
1425 `` the nearly insurmountable delegate math confronting him '' will be moot when hillary clinton has charges laid against her as a result of the email server investigation .
1426 yes , i 've heard .
1427 rt ( russia today ) - all the news that putin wants * you * to believe .
1428 yeah ... peace , prosperity , and job growth sure are awful .
1429 reaganism * bushism is just reaganism
1430 reince is very much a 'fall in line ' kinda guy .
1431 trump is toast now !
1432 if one of donald 's wives cheated on him , i 'm sure he would be really nice to the other guy .
1433 but it 's her turn
1434 that pretty much insures his re-election .
1435 the stock market is rigged against you
1436 i want to know what the pollsters say so i know whether or not i need to stop facebooking on the couch and actually go out to cast a vote !
1437 look at all those bernie bros .
1438 angry fired staffer makes unsubstantiated claims , suit says
1439 * hillary confused shrug face *
1440 i 'm sure that this had nothing to do with religion .
1441 irrelevant until after the conventions .
1442 how very tolerant of him
1443 i am sure that there was nothing unethical about what happened here .
1444 the federalist is a conservative site .
1445 this is the kind of people she works for , tax evaders
1446 no ralph , he 's losing due to the democratic system .
1447 wait , you 're surprised that reality may differ from what 's been circulating the reddit bubble of misinformation ?
1448 huckabee : `` god wants me to be preznit ''
1449 you can always trust rabidly right wing outlets to accurately paraphrase president obama 's speeches .
1450 trump is han solo
1451 thank you bernie supporters for handing trump the election .
1452 that is sexist
1453 pivoting away from his base .. fuck em
1454 missed the spelling and presumed we were talking about jimmy fallon and jim brewer .
1455 that does n't seem like a loaded question that 's attempting to make trump racist at all .
1456 odd to see this thread downvoted so quickly ...
1457 guys she 's the most transparent political candidate in modern history !
1458 who wants women to suffer ?
1459 adlai stevenson ?
1460 there is an answer , but it 's not defensible .
1461 clintons are some of the most trustworthy people i 've ever heard about .
1462 we get it !
1463 she 's merely reaching out to the people she wants to help her shape the future of america , for all people ... as long as those people have lots of money .
1464 i 'll be wearing my ceremonial tarp in solidarity .
1465 blows my mind that this person is even in contention to be president
1466 this election cycle is making house of cards look like a documentary .
1467 france should be more concerned about their government declaring and indefinite state of martial law than religious minorities existing .
1468 this is going to be a very tough call for a lot of republicans .
1469 the video at the bottom is a great summary .
1470 yeah , but where else would he go to complain ?
1471 dws
1472 oh man he 's really going against the establishment by having a wall street banker in his cabinet .
1473 this is worthy news to be on the front page .
1474 american thinker , fair and impartial .
1475 but was n't this a gop amendment ?
1476 whisky shots - to drown the sorrow of wasting $ 200 million from hard working low income families .
1477 how close minded to force the gay guy to be the secretary
1478 so that is why there are no threads about oregon voter fraud .
1479 they can go duck themselves right to heck .
1480 what are the odds that its not the 7s , 8s , 9s and 10s on the attractive skill getting harassed .
1481 probably outdated information .
1482 whoa phrasing !
1483 and as we can see , this worked well .
1484 the long con
1485 i 'm pretty sure it was numerous women that dropped the rape accusation on bill clinton , trump is just repeating them .
1486 i heard the aide said `` i do n't recall , '' some 42 times and is being held in contempt
1487 bernie bros are one of the reasons i 'm switch my vote from bernie to hillary .
1488 jeffrey epstein .
1489 you are confusing clinton with arithmetic .
1490 all the more reason why she should be elected to the most powerful position in the world .
1491 tldr they raye sanders supporters claims as false .
1492 that 's why so few members of congress are rich , right ?
1493 but , why ?
1494 only in a left leaning media can speaking poorly against your own self interest and in the interest of the working class be considered a negative ..... and theres people that nod their head when dumb shit like this is said ?
1495 thankfully , bernie 's spoiled supporters have parents with money .
1496 scroll down and the next article is 'why do greek statues have such small penises ? '
1497 i 'm sure hillary would be more than willing to look into it and address the matter in an open and transparent fashion
1498 hillary/cuban ticket ... hillary ultimately gets indicted/impeached/thrown in jail ... president cuban ?
1499 but i thought trump hates moooslims and is gon na round em up throw them all out ?
1500 use of the term sheeple disqualifies you from being taken seriously
1501 it 's not like he 'll need it for the general election .
1502 i 'm sure they 'll be clamoring to vote for trump .
1503 they used neither of their names in the title .
1504 thanks obama !
1505 sanders can win every primary from here on out and still be behind unless he wins by huge margins .
1506 he can shove his wall up his arse .
1507 only after hillary releases her transcripts !
1508 yep , this is the behavior of people i want deciding my country 's future .
1509 i have a fantastic idea for a consensus model : instead of not allowing women ( who dress and see themselves as men ) to go into the men 's bathroom , ban the gays ( men , who dress like women ) instead !
1510 she loses by getting less votes than her opponent .
1511 let 's go ahead and make it illegal to label gmos too .
1512 pretty much everything looks like the lesser of evils when compared to hillary and donald .
1513 what about all his victims that did n't survive ?
1514 obviously it 's because he 's a closet muslim terrorist trying to destroy freedom and murica !
1515 the concern that breitbart has for members of the democratic party running for office is truly touching .
1516 has he really ?
1517 why ca n't i actually find the transcript on that site ?
1518 well since she says so ... that makes it okay right guys ?
1519 there is a new word for that , anti-clinton .
1520 it 's what they offered .
1521 this is absolutely explosive and devastating !
1522 do you have any stock holdings ?
1523 they could ask bernie for a loan since they pissed away all their money on someone who is going to jail .
1524 and everything they asked for they got .
1525 it 's a hoax like that chinese invented global warming .
1526 it 's a security inquiry .... not an investigation .
1527 because the system is rigged , of course
1528 why would health insurance cover recreational drugs ?
1529 but he has $ 10 billion dollars !
1530 showing trump just how wrong he is about them being violent !
1531 fbi clearly stands for feminist bashing institute
1532 im no hillary supporter , but if `` leading media organizations '' say so , then she should listen !
1533 ok hillary , who made a promise that she will debate bernie before califronia rejects the debate now and that is fine , but the republican nominee should accept the fox news debate and debate the 2nd place person in historic fashion instead or he is a chicken !
1534 great source ; we all stand corrected !
1535 this guy wrote an article in september 2015 saying bernie was n't fit to be president .
1536 does n't everybody ?
1537 bernie `` i will not run a negative campaign '' sure seems negative lately
1538 people died ?
1539 thank you politifact , where would all be without you .
1540 well , when you ask for questions you have to give answers and god forbid if she should have to be subjected to that sexism !
1541 because the people who are asking us `` common folk '' to do this really consider the moral consequence of their actions
1542 go to any bar in my town and ask a bunch of drunks what they think of obama , and you 'll get the same basic response .
1543 you should know the bombs would only hit the evil iranians , not the good ones !
1544 he does it so when he goes home he does n't have to beat his kids .
1545 i watch beck so i 'm pretty sure the word is `` oligarh '' you ignorant fuck .
1546 maybe i 'm confused but did n't they already do that ?
1547 big surprise .
1548 i have been .
1549 * ad hominem * attacks have a way of biting you in the ass .
1550 too bad , peter schiff seems like a pretty smart guy .
1551 i had forgotten that he was the first to suggest investing social security in the stock market .
1552 teh muzlin !
1553 hate + ignorance = right wing talk radio
1554 islamic traffic accidents ?
1555 i am sure it was all a concern over property rights .
1556 i am going to vote republican this time around because i love it when they screw me up the butt and then tell me it 's my fault my ass is sore .
1557 must be bush .
1558 yes please more deficit spending
1559 leave it to the liberal conspiracy network to demonize a strong supporter of small independent business women .
1560 now we just have to get bachmann out of there .
1561 i am sure this will help the economy and create jobs .
1562 just what we need , more people in prison .
1563 here 's a foolproof way to determine what republicans are opposed to : if the answer to the question `` will this benefit anyone who makes less than $ 1 million each year '' is `` yes , '' then the republicans are opposed to it .
1564 ows : the most dangerous instance of the wealthy trying to use capitalism to destroy the wealth of others through wealth hating socialists in the world just now .
1565 weird i would think they would side with the banks
1566 it 's cool when democrats do it .
1567 its good too the money used to fight terrorism and the illicit drug gangs is being used for good use .
1568 yeah , cause that 's waaay more important than arming mexican drug cartels to kill innocent men , women , children , and us law enforcement agents .
1569 man , bob newhart is scaring the shit out of me .
1570 and this is why the militarization of cops is so terrifying .
1571 why does this have to come after my villian named karl rove ended up in oblivion from coh/cov now that ncsoft killed the servers .
1572 as long as you pay them in small bags of rice .
1573 figured it would be the least insane thing out of her mouth that causes conservative outrage .
1574 `` there will be blood '' because quoting a movie means you 're violent .
1575 republicans : oppose all three .
1576 damn .. what happened to kids just finding normal , regular hobbies .
1577 spingdale cleaners hands out their alternative abortion tool !
1578 well now , that makes it all better
1579 greedy union member !
1580 yes , but a redditor told me that last year 25000 people died in falls , so no discussion of gun deaths or any other deaths of kids is permitted until we solve this `` falling '' problem .
1581 how about a law that makes cemeteries only accessible if you have reason to be there .
1582 whats wrong with the sight ?
1583 this is the retroactive dilemma of the responsible gun owner at work .
1584 it should be noted that new orleans is a very secular place overall , so this is n't surprising .
1585 if this is what you believe then there is no reason to listen or talk to a republican ... i mean a party willing to do that ... will do anything .
1586 what an amazing story .
1587 interesting take on the issue .
1588 this is just more guns being added to the problem : (
1589 ohhhhhhhh scary scary , quick hide under your bed and tape your windows .
1590 your move catholics
1591 i 'm sure nothing will go wrong here .
1592 leader of attack 's name is mullet , lol
1593 i hate mexicans ever since the alamo .
1594 well you got ta bear in mind that the whole concussion is a democratic cover-up story so they can pass their real agenda under our noses
1595 rich people are hit by hurricanes too you know
1596 eli5 ?
1597 the drug war is working out to be a great success !
1598 both sides are the same .
1599 busy hands are happy hands .
1600 are you suggesting that those 35 americans do n't deserve permanent jobs , you commie slime-bag ?
1601 does n't make her less of a liar , child-abandoning , self-aggrandizing , money grubbing whore .
1602 the free market will clean that right up .
1603 yes , please , mr president , please go to cuba and normalize relations .
1604 guys i was just watching nbc and it is n't actually that bad
1605 oh , you have it wrong , new york times , if you are a worker you must be punished for it , low pay , poor housing , no health care , if you are a worker , it is your own fault .
1606 by making it functionally impossible to hold a private practice , such as what happened to this one .
1607 when you are angry or frustrated at someone , just hit them until they do what you want !
1608 well , madoff is a trust worthy guy
1609 i see no possible conflict of interest here .
1610 we did it !
1611 `` obamacare loses jobs for people on death panels . ''
1612 this was totally unforeseeable .
1613 big government needs to stay out of our business of fining people for missing political speeches by candidates running for the highest office in big government !
1614 they should rename their store to `` memories of a full bank account ''
1615 because there was totally a rampage of atheist discrimination in madison , thank goodness we 've gotten that taken care of , now we can go back to picketing chick-fil-a and wedding cake designers and staying in bed with iran and saudi arabia because we 're liberals and we have our priorities straight !
1616 it 's really hard to not make money when you put that kind of money to work .
1617 gon na need them guns when kansas finishes imploding on itself
1618 well my wife works at krogers and recently a woman bought 2 lobster tails , huge ones at 58 dollars a piece with her bridge card .
1619 they trade lobster and filet mignon for hooch and crack cocaine !
1620 because bible and prayer for information and effective leadership .
1621 historically speaking limiting the poors access to wealth has always helped raise them out of poverty .
1622 great , maybe leaders can 'condemn ' government corruption and really make a difference .
1623 that was the most well kept secret in the world .
1624 he must think there is money in it .
1625 because iran is a greater threat to our israeli overlord 's regional hegemony and they need us to secure it for them .
1626 newsflash : rural georgia person is hateful , ignorant racist .
1627 is he a scientologist ?
1628 remember folks , both parties are the same !
1629 : :turns to his car : : thanks , old honda .
1630 this is a great idea , because it has worked out so well in bc , canada .
1631 obligatory thanks obama .
1632 tl ; dr get a job ?
1633 this bill should be renamed the paris hilton bill .
1634 helping friends , what nice .
1635 let me guess , the constitution has a liberal bias ?
1636 aw heck , i was * just * about to put moneys on the president christie ticket , until this .
1637 typical woman .
1638 but think of all of the jobs they could create with that savings !
1639 well shit , this just cost her the election .
1640 yea because that 's one area that could use some cost cutting measures to increase profitability .
1641 well that 's why we need stronger voter id laws , to make sure all these illegal immigrants are n't casting ballots for the democrats !
1642 by making them suffer it not only lets them experience true christian love like jesus did , but also encourages them to not be poor ...
1643 next thing you know dogs will be marrying cats !
1644 at an average age of 75 , it probably wo n't .
1645 the jury is still out on this dna stuff , i suppose .
1646 or all the millennials are just lazy good-for-nothing 's
1647 emotional instability is what i look for in a candidate .
1648 this is a wonderfully non-biased web site you posted here .
1649 they are voting to destroy christianity !
1650 it makes me nervous seeing all these thugs in the streets .
1651 and people wonder why wikileaks was necessary ... and why julian assange is a virtual prisoner right now .
1652 i wo n't be satisfied until mcdonalds starts hauling the homeless off the streets of delhi to work in their american restaurants .
1653 same old song and dance .
1654 i 'll bring the marshmallows !
1655 blaming your poor product on higher expenses is not a way to run a business .
1656 it 's just because they love the babbys so much !
1657 and this ( just like people who loudly pray in public ) is the mark of a true patriot
1658 wapo is in the tank for trump
1659 who are quite conservative .
1660 vp selections might be more important that usual this time around -- although biden literally was n't allowed to do anything and was completely a joke
1661 apparently a bunch of berniebros are running rampant from within the democratic leadership with all this sexism and misogyny of suggesting to replace hillary clinton .
1662 lack of transparency is just what i look for in a president .
1663 another spectacular article by wapo
1664 stupid establishment asians
1665 right wing police state sycophants who complain about `` big gubment '' what say you ?
1666 this sounds like another right wing conspiracy
1667 world nut daily
1668 * after * they dropped the lawsuits
1669 to be fair , it was a community college .
1670 she needs a prescription so she does n't look so anxious and nervous in her interviews .
1671 its just a `` parking ticket '' everyone chill out .
1672 hillary is pro-net neutrality .
1673 because as everyone in the past has found out , if you want to take down trump attack ads are suppppperrr effective
1674 seems legit .
1675 please tell me this is satire .
1676 neither are the jews , stay safe fellow fascist .
1677 bill clinton came to pr the week before the party cut the number of polling places ...
1678 this from the worst mayor of new york city in a century .
1679 good job with the -58 ec votes swing bernie
1680 she 's probably a big sharks fan too
1681 `` we 're protesting because trump and his supporters are violent bigots spreading a hateful message ! ''
1682 i do n't know one democrat who says this .
1683 the blacks love him .
1684 trump is a racist
1685 * * washington post reports on monster that the left created * * fixed that headline
1686 no , they 're just donating to charity because they think the clinton 's hold the best charity ... alright guys , i need a new script , i do n't think this is gon na cut it .
1687 ... happy days are here again
1688 every time she answers a question , her poll numbers drop
1689 did you also learn that these super delegates were bought and paid for months ago ?
1690 3,000+ upvotes , horrible article /notsurprised
1691 i guess that amazing speech was mostly half true ... so presidential
1692 i am appalled , these peasants are * revolting * .
1693 so i guess 2 guys = some of bernie 's supports
1694 he 's gon na put gold trim on it and put a fountain in front .
1695 yeah , but they 're not real muslims
1696 and then orders another , bigger , airstrike .
1697 well , its the same people who cry racism or sexism or intolerant bigot when they dont get their way , demanding safe spaces and screaming at anyone with a different opinion why should we be surprised they are crying now i look forward to sanders going to the convention and taking his army of cry babys with him it will provide some great entertainment
1698 yeah , venezuela is such a successful socialist utopia , that its favor trumps that of the united states .
1699 trump is going to have a field day with this bitch .
1700 she has evolved
1701 but seriously , this is great .
1702 let 's be fair , maybe she bought the jacket at a thrift store or at a goodwill .
1703 yeah i bet you 're right
1704 snowden should come home now .
1705 everyone knows that only straight white cisgender men can make fair , unbiased decisions without identity politics getting in the way .
1706 what a great link that makes this exact argument
1707 slow news day , great time to release this .
1708 thanks to the perpetually offended , the racism word has lost it 's meaning
1709 okay i 'll just pretend sanders is the winner , hell why not even the president of were just making up our own narrative
1710 yeah , but he screwed a latina and had an anchor baby with her so he 's biased too .
1711 clinton supporters are the party .
1712 oh goody , as the bad news for bernie submission suppression is coming to an end , bad news for trump submissions can start getting the suppression treatment in their place .
1713 its always a good idea to wait til the last moment .
1714 i really like trump 's position on the `` ppp . ''
1715 they dont support him for his views , they support him so they can spew their racists views .
1716 wow , trump is starting to look like a real politician ...
1717 i 'm sure brietbart has a sincere concern about advancing the progressive cause in this country .
1718 stage 5- acceptance
1719 i 'm sure they will take action just like they did when cheney outed valerie plame .
1720 as a wisconsinite i can tell you that would be very bad .
1721 here comes the liberals to tell them they are wrong because they are not white .
1722 hey at least it 's better than crooked hillary
1723 finally proving the tie between the anti-illegal immigration crowd and paedophilia
1724 hah , awesome .
1725 you 're so full of shit , but have fun .
1726 sure are a lot of hillbots trying desperately to say none of this matters .
1727 she did n't she sold the thing she promised long ago .
1728 maybe all of them were sanders supporters .
1729 that 's very sexist of her .
1730 innuendos are the weapon of the billionaire class .
1731 nothing to see here then , let 's move on .
1732 * i 'm sure these two tweets ( which are both deleted ) totally was n't a marketing attempt from the start *
1733 really bringing out the big guns today are n't we guys
1734 a staffer tweeted `` delete your account '' such ownage
1735 just wait til everyone hears about the ax he is running with : proposal to cut the federal budget by 43 % was his plan in 2012
1736 hoo boy she is going to lose now
1737 to the front page !
1738 as if i give a fuck who jesse jackson endorses .
1739 wow , neil young sure showed him !
1740 how is this not whataboutism ?
1741 right , a great idea , given trump in a party without superdelegates .
1742 /r/timcanova up and down , people .
1743 anyone else remember the `` this is what a feminist looks like '' shirts being made by similar sweatshop women ?
1744 well , time to revert to sending smoke signals .
1745 what an sjw
1746 what a shitty headline , in other news : i did not like fish , until i did
1747 because what comes out of her mouth can definitely be trusted
1748 well of course * she * would say that .
1749 fuck islam .
1750 what could possibly go wrong with this brilliant scheme ?
1751 simple answers for the simple minded .
1752 obama 's failure to allow criticism of radical islam is what caused this tragedy
1753 yeah , owners fault for not planning for a mass shooting at their club ..
1754 i know when i go dancing , i really want to be wearing a bulky harness with a large weight of metal on one side of my body .
1755 that sounds like something an islamic terrorist would say .
1756 and that 's why obama is responsible for this act of terrorism
1757 that would certainly provide some evidence that perhaps just maybe russia was able to get their hands on her emails
1758 wait for them , they are coming .
1759 trump is simply not ready for prime time .
1760 who cares about issues now , hillary is evil and anything but her
1761 you obviously did n't see the lt gov 's tweet
1762 gee i ca n't imagine why .
1763 since the shooter was radicalized on the internet , we should probably ban that too .
1764 there goes obama , colluding with isis again !
1765 a lot of republicans are saying it does n't matter because a republican will be president either way .
1766 well fuck now eithet our internet is going to become `` safe '' or we are going to get the nsa shoved down our throat like a fucking bonzi buddy program .
1767 christie is taking over the republican void created when lindsay flip flopped on trump .
1768 we have the best weapons , you will love our weapons .
1769 yeah , but my feelings are hurt , so i 'm not going to vote !
1770 im pretty sure bernies campaign warned twice that the dnc database had vulnerabilities , but they refused to do anything and tried to oust bernie for cheating .
1771 yes , way more visible too .
1772 maybe they 'll blame the republicans when we find out her majesty 's secret server was hacked too and the band played on
1773 it does n't matter if he drops out or not - the race has moved on without him .
1774 it 's not the muslim terrorists killing people you should be afraid of , no it 's trump for saying he 's going to do something about it .
1775 yea , because pc culture , being tolerant , is the reason .
1776 well what about those coming in from the countries the dont like them ?
1777 100 % of people with more than a tentative grasp on reality .
1778 i 'm glad cornel west can speak for all of us ......
1779 yeah , because everything happens in its own individual bubble .
1780 /thread
1781 i guarantee you hrc will be the honored on stage guest at their opening performance
1782 probably killing more kids at sandy hook
1783 some say politifact supported hillary clinton , but that 's a conspiracy theory too .
1784 corporations are people too , my friend .
1785 because the best time to pass laws is always after a tragic event , when everybody is thinking clearly
1786 `` allow votes '' wow what a great democratic system
1787 maybe putting the reality tv star who ca n't keep his racist pie-hole shut in charge was n't such a good idea , gop .
1788 get this gun-grabbing liberal out of here !
1789 wow what a huge fucking surprise .
1790 right he just has to wait for shillary to be arrested for murder or whatever and he will be in the white house .
1791 chinese hoax .
1792 seems legit .
1793 trump will definitely win the woman vote this way !
1794 dude your username is on point
1795 good way to spend taxpayer money .
1796 looks to be interesting .
1797 he should have been aborted .
1798 always on the right side of history , this one .
1799 that red conditional formatting for `` outstanding donations '' is pretty bad
1800 please list benefits/consequences of britain leaving eu , and the impact it will have on us politics and economy .
1801 * * its her time , forget the crime * * -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
1802 according to most her followers this is incorrect as they believe obama was told she was innocent thus freeing the way for him to enforce her .
1803 all maters of law are now solved via thunderdome in the white house lawn .
1804 this is n't really a revelation , most of what we 've done in that region ends up being `` for israel '' in some way .
1805 if clinton * does n't * pick warren because of this ... say goodbye to sanders .
1806 immediately after the ussc gave the ok to finger print anyone who comes in contact with law enforcement , i was pulled over for driving without a license , my license was actually fine , there was a clerical error with the clerk of court tho .... but i was hand cuffed and taken to the police station and finger printed , and had my work van impounded at 8am on my way to a business appointment ... i 'd wager none of the conservative ussc justices have found themselves in that situation , now they have my prints , next they will allow them to take my dna , iphone data and bank card data if law enforcement makes contact with me , to keep them safe from the clerical error criminals
1807 is i n't that mc lovin ?
1808 the senators in this photo did not vote down this proposal .
1809 we need to ban all brits until we can figure this out
1810 thanks for the moment of comedy , op !
1811 ca n't have weapons manufacturers ' feelings getting damaged now can we ?
1812 calling bernie supporters bernie bro 's and obama supporters obama boys is the highest form of praise in elizabethan english .
1813 in light of this hack , i am still convinced that hrc 's microsoft exchange email server , stored in her bathroom closet remain secure .
1814 are we allowed to talk about that ?
1815 big who cares
1816 with donald trump being largely quiet for the last couple of days , we were beginning to fear that people would forget that republicans hate women .
1817 well , you know what they say , a non-criminal is just a criminal that has n't been caught yet !
1818 some hard hitting journalism right here
1819 those who surrender freedom for security will not have , nor do they deserve , either one
1820 oh my god trump told more lies about hillary , that is so out of character for him as he usually is so honest
1821 i really thought it would be crazy to pick warren as vp but the media is really trying to make it look like thats whats going to happen .
1822 why do we even do these things ?
1823 who could have possibly predicted sanders supporters would n't support clinton ?
1824 she did n't need the security because she knew she would be getting a `` security inquiry ''
1825 this is the same attack used on the bernie supporters when they stand up for something
1826 yeah , even if you ignore that op posted fom a main stream news source , you would be really hard pressed to find anything negative about the clintons .
1827 this will do well to move people to trump .
1828 when you are being called out by an organization that rejects the current interpretation of the 2nd amendment according to the supreme court , you know your position is untenable .
1829 oh good .
1830 if he added the phrase `` breaking down barriers '' after each bullet point , would that be specific enough ?
1831 itt : perennial clinton apologists who are as technologically competent as she is .
1832 did n't he have 8 years to do that ?
1833 it almost sounds like someone should say something about it .
1834 the very definition of manufacturing consent .
1835 to the front page !
1836 shocking
1837 trump 's fool proof ask them system would prevent that
1838 it usually is .
1839 how very tolerant of them .
1840 but the media told me obamacare was a big success !
1841 next up : federal law bans people who have had detention from owning guns
1842 yeah , cause `` trickle down '' economics was such a huge success
1843 come on ny !
1844 jeff sessions is totally not a lying racist scumbag and i believe 100 % of what he says
1845 the lack of evidence is clear evidence that she and barry covered it up , obviously .
1846 she wants to stop you from doing what she does .
1847 what a sellout
1848 lmao no it is n't but okay
1849 wishing his father would have pulled out .
1850 i hate tpp as much as the next guy , but this kind of rhetoric is just insane !
1851 as any good constitutional originalist will tell you , the founders did n't really mean `` well regulated '' , and the amendment is up for interpretation .
1852 sometimes you have to do horrible things to get results .
1853 yeah , based on bills past , he should know better than to do something stupid !
1854 remember folks , both parties are the same .
1855 they need to build a wall around the airports .
1856 i 'll lay money on it !
1857 there are some adblock programs that also get around those , like `` ublock origin ''
1858 hopefully they do n't give us a president trump .
1859 nonsense , they were simply discussing bill 's nice round of golf in the current pleasant 100+ degree phoenix weather .
1860 donald trump = fascist hillary clinton = fascist lite
1861 having shootouts in night clubs is preferable to having basic gun laws
1862 clinton/lynch for prison 2016 .
1863 i am sure this will get plenty of coverage ... the whole country will be talking about it tomorrow !
1864 call mel gibson on his hotline .
1865 pro tip : choose ppo over hmo if you have any choice in the matter .
1866 i love it when a link re sizes my browser window .
1867 single payer care is why people come from all over the world to the mayo clinic in brandon , manitoba .
1868 yeah , it 's much better to have your healthcare in the hands of an insurance company , where their sole goal is to maximize shareholder profits .
1869 universal home payments !
1870 i do n't have any muslim friends : - (
1871 and what a fantastic two years they 've been .
1872 the 20th century was overrated .
1873 but we pay for it and it is a capitalist venture , so it is an american good death right ?
1874 lady gaga is an embarrassment
1875 cojones .
1876 initial ?
1877 if i were dudley i would n't be going out to eat for a while .
1878 bank of america to charge $ 5 per month fee to non-customers for prospective account placeholder maintenance .
1879 `` an isolated incident '' , `` not all cops are like this '' , `` a few bad apples '' , `` if she 'd followed the law she would n't have had this problem '' , `` he was just doing his job ''
1880 time for revolution
1881 but tax cuts produce more revenue !
1882 he better hope no one was reading his lips .
1883 this should be required not charity
1884 must be nice to have a monopoly .
1885 `` i 'm god and i approve this message . ''
1886 they were clearly agitating those peace officers .
1887 clearly this is why it is better to have local communities with all the power .
1888 ron paul does not believe in evolution
1889 welcome to the us of fascism !
1890 this is why i get my news from the bible and not tv/magazines
1891 tebow wins , palin does n't .
1892 so it did n't work the last two times , must be because it was too small .
1893 ... what a fascist
1894 tasers and pepperspray should fall under the same regulation as firearms .
1895 reminds me of chris rock : `` i 'm not saying he should have killed her , but i understand . ''
1896 illinois is about to get a lot more dangerous
1897 ah , the new year , the new congress , all will well this year , i can feel it !
1898 yes , guns are the reason detroit is a cesspool resembling a 3rd world country .
1899 that 's some good shooting ...... score one for the good guys .
1900 people who do n't have jobs are n't people ; problem solved .
1901 that 's fucked up .
1902 he must be the first to do that !
1903 but but but , how else will po 's be able to make quotas ?
1904 our version of society is so fucked up that this almost does n't even count as `` ironic '' .
1905 i 'm sure it could n't possibly be associated with the high cost of health care in the usa that means that parents are much less likely to visit a gp ensuring that an easily solved minor issue can develop into a fatal emergency .
1906 yeah , no hidden agenda behind this action .
1907 this is one of the best ideas ever
1908 they should have done it before they had kids
1909 pics or it didnt happen
1910 scott the engineer is the only one on the show that understands politics !
1911 science has a well noted liberal bias
1912 of course he means , dehumanized , not deprogrammed .
1913 excuses from authoritarian wannabes .
1914 i 'm glad to hear that , because this is important and it 's a significant problem that needs solving .
1915 yeah , that will * sail * through congress .
1916 fire him and ride him off university grounds on a rail .
1917 but what is the myth ?
1918 i 'm so proud to be a virginian
1919 and here come the conspiratards ...
1920 sigh , this article is poorly written and the title reinforces the incorrect notion that you pay the entirety of your income in whatever bracket you fall into .
1921 got ta love my state !
1922 with eloquent spokesmen like this how can they fail ?
1923 funny thing , advantaged kids can read good cuz of all that lawyer talk their rich parents make them learn ; while poor children are good at math cause they starve if they arent .
1924 i 'm sure his life will be extremely difficult now .
1925 because there are n't millions of pot smokers already
1926 last time it was to make obama a one term president , and we see how well they did there .
1927 something this mean-spirited and vile could only come out of the democratic party .
1928 we should just abolish the atf and dea , since they fail to do anything remotely affective , nah .. lets just keep wasting billions of citizens dollars every year
1929 because shes an idiot ?
1930 will his fascist gun grabbing never end ?
1931 i do n't know if all boy scouts are gays , they could probably tie the knot like fifty different ways .
1932 plus , 60 minutes did n't grill obama about the super-long-form birth certificate that * * still * * has n't been released .
1933 and i 'm sure clear channel 's decision to shut down the only liberal/progressive talk radio station in the portland metropolitan area ( oregon ) a week after the november election so they could open a third sports station shows absolutely no media bias either !
1934 solution : work at a temp agency .
1935 your tax dollars at work
1936 yes because most of them are too stupid to know if their gun is loaded and end up shooting a friend or family member .
1937 shame you ca n't buy stocks with food stamps .
1938 gasoline combustion engine
1939 how about while he 's trying to do things that most likely will not be passed , he get religious groups to pay taxes too ?
1940 it 's actually the bill to `` save american workers * from * healthcare '' .
1941 yeah and nafta was such a economic sucess .
1942 you just ca n't have people using science and learning things .
1943 did they poll all of the small to medium sized business owners that will let the extra employees go because they 'll be costing them money per hour , instead of making them money per hour ?
1944 ooh i know , let 's blame the poor people , college grads , and real people instead of the banks and other multinational corporations we should dismantle !
1945 how is she still in office ?
1946 well , she should n't have gotten sick in the first place
1947 probably because politicians figure giving tax breaks to big companies like this creates new jobs in the us , while simultaneously giving citizens cheaper gas ; lol .
1948 yeah that 's going to happen .
1949 i do n't think i 've ever quoted george carlin , but this and that fiasco in the texas board of education a few years ago remind me of his bit about `` just smart enough to run the machines , but too stupid to know how badly you 're getting fucked ''
1950 how long before breitbart runs a semi-racist article about michelle burning tax payer monies ?
1951 well duh , you have to know a black person to get close enough to them
1952 yeah .... spending $ 33,000 in public funds on a personal coach for your political campaign is just a teeny tiny problem .
1953 the atf should be abolished !
1954 no way that will be abused
1955 hey , fellows , now obamacare is reducing people 's benefits as well as making them pay for benefits they will not be using !
1956 absolutely no connection between the two at all .
1957 the real question should be , what does carter have to hide ?
1958 hate to say it , but it 's always been an oligarchic society .
1959 yeah , because so much good comes from fear .
1960 what they obviously need are ... `` more tax cuts . ''
1961 americans are right to fear the evils of socialism , just look at the hellscape that is scandinavia !
1962 how can they know it is fracking chemicals if the fracking chemical ingredients are trade secrets the companies are n't required to disclose ?
1963 onion , just admit it , you 're a bunch of amateurs compared to these guys .
1964 i thought you could just pray that away .
1965 this was in january fyi .
1966 i think you also need to roll in billion dollar corporations since we 've made the boneheaded choice to treat them as people in the us .
1967 because only people younger than 18 are having sex and premarital sex is a sin .
1968 is `` fuck off and die '' an intention he is pondering ?
1969 yeah , but most of them are living large and own things like refrigerator and have running water , so they just need to stop whining like poor little children .
1970 looks like bender bending rodriguez made his own military .
1971 louis the 16th was smarter than king .
1972 as someone in healthcare business this is a direct violation to the patient 's rights to know about their health .
1973 bernie sanders misogynist extraordinaire .
1974 great , freedom of religion just went down the tubes .
1975 and 9-11 was an inside job
1976 yeah , classy ... let 's make this guy president .
1977 but catholics are n't christians !
1978 another of the `` accomplishments '' of the arrogant , incompetent white house buffoon .
1979 shit like this is why we need to really update the constitution !
1980 okay
1981 needs more trickle down
1982 idiotic idea from a socialist pandering to idiots .
1983 jeb bush winning over millennials one gaff at a time .
1984 well , at least you 're human .
1985 one of the interns wrote `` legalize weed '' wrong on accident and now we 're here
1986 is it sanctions ?
1987 can you effectively monitor iran 's nuclear activities if you do n't have access to its military sites ?
1988 yeah , and the financial crisis he inherited from bush is obama 's fault as well ... or we can blame w. for the shit w. did .
1989 is n't it a really good thing that the fbi came out and said this ?
1990 well , at least josh duggar is n't gay because that would be unforgiveable !
1991 he must 've really pissed off al gore , since you know he invented the internet .
1992 oh look at that , i guess it 's time for the police to arrest more people for jay walking , loitering , drinking beer in public , and menacing .
1993 at least it was n't wasted , it went right to the economy thanks to all that defense spending !
1994 yeah i feel really sorry for him .
1995 while we 're at it , let 's prohibit the fossil fuel industry from obtaining tax subsidies/rebates .
1996 what does that even mean ?
1997 well if you pinko liberals get to inject science into the classroom we should get to inject our religion too !
1998 yeah you know , not korematsu that rubber stamped fdr 's executive order to illegally imprison japanese americans ... not dredd scott declaring that black people were n't people ... no no , citizens united , when the left tried to go after a non-profit group for making a documentary highly critical of hillary clinton - oh yes , that 's the worst supreme court decision .
1999 this will of course solve the problem of unemployment among college graduates .
2000 a good chunk of this sub .
2001 'rein in ' like a horse ?
2002 that picture makes him look like a thumb .
2003 is there a wawa near the white house ?
2004 forget the women and children save the congressmen first .
2005 clearly a racist and xenophobic article .
2006 this was sometime after obama forged his us birth certificate and college grades .
2007 i did n't no my dick could get so hard
2008 yes , an emoji and not actual policy and solutions ought to fix this !
2009 comey better watch out for gym equipment .
2010 well they didnt walk her out in chains from the interview about the review , so , nothing left to see here guys .
2011 at this point , what difference does it make ?
2012 where is that hand coming from ?
2013 kinda makes me wonder why the fbi went ahead and had the interview today if they already knew the outcome .
2014 this is all because trump is running for president iirc
2015 i saw thar truck near hillary clinton 's house after she was asked to publish the speech transcripts .
2016 well she did push the `` gold standard '' of trade deals 45 times .
2017 please provide a link , as far as i can tell there 's nothing in the aca ( obamacare ) about single-payer .
2018 hell even vermont voted theirs out due to being too expensive
2019 because it 's a conspiracy obviously
2020 wow , after only 300 posts about this the past days i had no idea !
2021 wow you sure do make the exact same comment in dozens of hillary threads over and over and over again .
2022 but that one r-asmussen poll says that trump is going to win in a landslide just like romney did !
2023 that 's great , what 's his tax policy ?
2024 obama to campaign with clinton as fbi confirms what legal experts had been saying for months but bloodthirsty redditors had refused to hear
2025 you do n't understand , it 's all about intent to blaze it
2026 at the end of the day , paul ryan is an oligarchic boot-licker who will say what he 's told to say by his masters .
2027 must be all them gun laws working .
2028 ohhhh , now i understand .
2029 i like how he praises the idea of executing people without any regard for their 'rights ' how the hell can any constitutionalist support this guy
2030 wow , cnn with a headline like that ... maybe there 's hope after all .
2031 i 'm sure after he `` answers '' all of these questions it will all be put the rest and we will never ever hear anything about it ever again .
2032 yes , he failed them , he has to go .
2033 breitbutt racist fucks spin has already begun in baton rouge shooting .
2034 yeah and clinton can totally be trusted with classified info
2035 because he 's got so much more info than the fbi does .
2036 meanwhile in other news brain dead is streaming free for amazon prime members .
2037 white christians are oppressed in america
2038 good luck proving she knowingly stated a falsehood .
2039 welp , that 's it , you convinced me to vote trump
2040 the ride never ends .
2041 so whats the latest score in this game terrorists vs cops
2042 for the man who just told the republicans he 'd `` be the best constitutional president ever '' he might want to know what the fuck it contains first .
2043 the under oath part does n't really matter , since perjury is a specific intent crime and impossible to prove , since it would rely on evidence that comey could n't even produce in the emails case .
2044 blm and dallas pd have respect for each other , this sniper is a moron .
2045 after reading the article i still feel there is only one canidate that does `` place america before any personal ambitions '' and his name is bernie !
2046 this is a big deal , because no one has ever called for the death of donald trump
2047 yea ... , that 's exactly what she said .
2048 makkke america safe again
2049 thanks vox , we 've known for a decade .
2050 pressure or not , why would any company that actually cares about its image want to part of this shitshow ?
2051 if only the killer would have told us what the motive is ... guess we 'll never know = (
2052 i 'm so happy that the gop is the party of small government , woooo !
2053 infrastructure will be great with christie
2054 so excited for her to change her mind once she does n't have to pander !
2055 only white people can commit hate crimes , now get with this admistrations narrative or i 'll charge you with a hate crime .
2056 the mods are too sad to make this a sticky .
2057 the judicial branch was n't involved in this .
2058 shouldnt that be 101 % ?
2059 but trump won the nevada primary by a lot !
2060 people will say his campaign is a disaster until he wins in november , then they 'll just say all the millions of people who voted for him are racist , sexist , xenophobic , islamophic , homophobic , transphobic , and anti-semitic to explain why he won .
2061 an abuela we can all trust !
2062 that 's only true for candidates who have n't officially been found to be pathological liars .
2063 considering jeb is always sad maybe this is an omen that trump is going to win
2064 whether you like or dislike trump , he has a point here .
2065 because their ideologies are so similar
2066 ding , we have a winner .
2067 oh if that 's true , then there is no such thing as global warming .
2068 so a friday news dump then ?
2069 but she 's the electable one !
2070 i wonder how many times people will leave the `` reddit said '' comment and think it 's original or that it makes sense .
2071 i 'm with her , because there just is n't enough corruption in government these days .
2072 it 's ok they just misspoke
2073 oh , but clinton 's such a better candidate than sanders because she won the * red states that wo n't matter * in the general election .
2074 yeah , the media sure is ignoring her email scandal
2075 but i was told trump has already won the election !
2076 this sounds interesting
2077 mike pence took a brave stand against the establishment pc police who run the big bad `` cigarettes cause cancer '' fear campaign .
2078 i 'm glad he was on the democratic platform committee then .
2079 ironic how the purported `` constitution party '' has very little respect for the constitution .
2080 pocket change for donald , no worries !
2081 quality content
2082 all those happy pacified muslim communities , finally reunited by uprooting a sizable portion of their population .
2083 so if a child somehow managed to stumble on to a pro-isis website , the parents would be punished right ?
2084 i 'm still not sure what his endgame is though
2085 it 's funny because i 'm 12 and dicks are funney
2086 `` possible ''
2087 i 'm gon na hold off on deciding whether i favor this until i hear what trump has to say .
2088 random
2089 but donald trump had a black guy at one of his rallies so he ca n't be racist
2090 kind of like investing in casinos with nothing but borrowed money .
2091 i believe there are many people in this country who think that we are somehow above this type of behavior , thus it could n't happen .
2092 my american friends are loving this .
2093 just more 5d chess he 's gon na act like a complete idiot up until the debates then , bam , go full college professor with his responses !
2094 does this include mosques and synagogues too ?
2095 as someone who has had tsa steal from my checked luggage twice , i could not be less surprised by this
2096 we can be sure the oh so concerned * esquire * has covered the whiteness of the us government in the past .
2097 i think `` risk '' is a very hopeful way of putting it .
2098 man , every looney toon just comes out of wood works during a presidential run dont they ?
2099 why ?
2100 they 're going to have to have ailes ' office steam-cleaned .
2101 has been .
2102 trying desperately to re-engage the white voters
2103 drone them based on cellphone usage patterns !
2104 of course he does .. he 's a racist .
2105 not sure why iowa thinks being the first to vote in the primary is something to be proud of , when that state is the harbinger of failure .
2106 i 'd much rather have the racist , misogynistic , xenophobic , nativist authoritarian who is also a criminal !
2107 what an awesome presidential candidate - blames everything on everyone else .
2108 and i would be ok with that .
2109 what a shame that would be .
2110 before i saw this i thought she was a highly educated genius
2111 it 's already g shooting out of one hole there .
2112 buyer 's remorse ?
2113 nice reasoned , intellectual speech by ben carson , as per usual .
2114 poll : most earthicans see trump unfavorably , but somehow he is statistically tied .
2115 yeah , if it 's one thing the times is known for it 's `` typical rumor mill bullshit . ''
2116 damn what a shame that would be
2117 not to mention no one has looked into benghazi nor talked about it .
2118 sadly , the rick roll was not mentioned in the statement .
2119 it will be when $ hillary appoints herself eternal monarch and enacts genocide against whites .
2120 every time i hear about this guy i automatically think of dan egan in veep .
2121 the donation to her campaign came after she dropped the charges so its legit ...... silly liberals .
2122 funny because i read his quoted remarks and they 're about culture , not whiteness .
2123 sabotage !
2124 oh yes , politifact presenting the information without bias
2125 really surprised at the thumbnail next to the thread title
2126 i 'd wager a bet on dems rejecting more white interns than gop rejecting minorities .
2127 everyone in the gop hates everyone else in the gop .
2128 crooked hillary strikes again !
2129 why is this a bad choice ?
2130 i thought they were only worth 1 billion ?
2131 and literally no one cared .
2132 he got resigned because he let trump win .
2133 no one else was going to forgive him
2134 cuban 's just bitter that his apprentice clone , `` the benefactor '' , was shit .
2135 oh man we lost so many jobs because of nafta
2136 shocker !
2137 no fear mongering here ... just some honest , unbiased journalism
2138 hope blm looks after the hellary convention security details .
2139 my hero .
2140 but you have plenty of people jumping to conclusions as well .
2141 i 'll never trust the zodiac killer el rato .
2142 oh boy , he 's gon na be pissed when she does n't sign it .
2143 fuck you , politico
2144 progress is not equal to bending the knee to hillary you fascist .
2145 he 's obviously a southern state
2146 not a hillary clinton email dump .... dnc email dump .
2147 clickbait title
2148 rekt
2149 small fucking wonder when the american military defends most of europe , south korea and japan .
2150 democratic voter suppression !
2151 stock market at record highs crime at record lows employment getting so good interest rates need to be increased yeah horrible
2152 this clinton lady sounds like a real class act
2153 making someone an `` honorary '' anything is the same thing as telling them not to show up ever again .
2154 roger ailes is just a rich billionaire with a credible and bipartisan news organization that helped launch the careers of many respectable journalist that is being unfairly targeted by evil women
2155 i feel so sorry for her .
2156 this particular email deserves its own thread .
2157 as an australian - i for one welcome our new trump overlords
2158 if you 're not voting for hillary clinton , you 're a conservative , and easily in the dumber half of all americans that have ever lived .
2159 this is spoken like someone who has never been a part of the democratic party and has no idea how it works .
2160 ctr newest talking point : russia .
2161 exactly .
2162 is newsmax a liberal biased source or ?
2163 seems legit .
2164 the russians have no business manipulating our elections , the dnc should be the only people allowed to subvert our democracy !
2165 michelle obama was quite upset that she had to cancel the wwe-style entrance after last week 's rnc .
2166 ... and this was how donald trump won the 2016 election , congratulations democrats , you idiots .
2167 i 'm sure nypost has a 'reliable ' source to back up its claim right ?
2168 you bernie bros need to just grow the fuck up and accept the corruption and undermining of democracy that has been going on
2169 right , because the clinton news network ( cnn ) is an unbiased trustworthy source on this matter .
2170 just another one of those young , white bernie bros who just got into the election to burn everything down .
2171 so democrats are n't fear-mongering about trump ?
2172 still better than trump .
2173 they 're not .
2174 private sector race baiting with sharpton no doubt .
2175 if they attacked christian , they would n't give a shit .
2176 shhh no do n't .. let her lose
2177 oh , i did n't realize it was already november
2178 so glad my daughter will have this inspiring role model to look up to .
2179 regardless , the source needs to be looked into .
2180 i read the headline and honestly did n't know which position she would be flipping from .
2181 his body is n't even cold yet , and she 's already turned around to fuck his supporters in the ass
2182 clash with police just like they threw chairs in nevada
2183 fox news has a conservative bias , and often editorializes well beyond any reasonable interpretation of the facts at hand .
2184 the ol ' `` algorithm '' is messing up again guys nothing to see here .
2185 what difference does it make ?
2186 no its your fault for not taking bills throbbing member down your esophagus !
2187 bill , would you be okay with changing your contract so you have to live in a hut behind fox news and do whatever they want and only be paid in food , for the rest of your life ?
2188 he also ate a girl out in the oval office .
2189 ya know , cuz trump is the guy who gave russians the idea to spy on the usa
2190 yeah 2000 was a great one too !
2191 who was born to huge wealth , then got away with driving four companies into bankruptcy , stiffing most of his contractors ?
2192 yea obama been great you can tell by all the racial harmony .
2193 that 's what turned me libertarian .
2194 well , you know hillary , all states border vermont so you should win in a landslide .
2195 what is up with the flag burning ?
2196 guess we should have just asked him about * rampart *
2197 nancy pelosi is out of touch with reality .
2198 who is this guy ?
2199 tim kaine was a big fat mistake .
2200 free ponies and mandatory teeth brushing .
2201 mid convention slump , classic , happens all the time , nothing to see here , move along
2202 devastating .
2203 it 's almost as if the immigration policy is supposed to benefit the host country and its citizens first , not the immigrants
2204 im sure they will elaborate i ca n't wait to hear .
2205 lmao good fucking luck
2206 the convention is literally a celebration of her , who else would they choose to end it ?
2207 but ... but ... they hied actors to fill the seats
2208 or , they flat out refused because they knew there was a shitton of shady and illegal stuff on the severs as it is ... just saying .
2209 that 's because they are .
2210 hillary 's running as a democrat though
2211 it 's unfortunate that there are only these three sources of journalism in western media .
2212 what a trooper .
2213 that just might inspire even more votes for hrc !
2214 yes , please , put this man in charge of the world 's most powerful arsenal of weapons .
2215 but still better than hillary , right guys ?
2216 how many delegates at the rnc are lobbyists ?
2217 he has learned something from his dictator hero 's .
2218 this is the person we want holding the nuclear launch codes .
2219 surprise !
2220 it touches my heart to learn how deeply concerned the american conservative is with the well being of the left .
2221 considering the timing and manning 's connection to wikileaks , maybe they 're trying to influence assange by torturing his accomplice .
2222 i ca n't wait for round two of leaks , the dnc is a * mess * .
2223 lmao , buzzfeed just happened to `` find '' a memo at a hotel , how lucky for then
2224 true : clinton once said that marriage was between a man and a woman
2225 who ?
2226 yep
2227 huh
2228 and in other news , trump invited a foreign enemy to hack our government .
2229 i hope giant meteor shows up unannounced to one of the debates .
2230 yeah but trump so i have to vote for hillary
2231 game changer
2232 this headline is misleading
2233 let 's ban all violent video games that will get the youth right ?
2234 republicans would rather debate a bill to list magic as an art form
2235 to quote from eve : not winning fast enough
2236 trump does n't need their money .
2237 oh that money does n't bias her in any way though .
2238 come on guys , he 's joking
2239 this is kind of remarkable considering his campaign manager worked directly for viktor yanukovych , a putin puppet in ukraine , and was directly involved in russian-ukrainian relations .
2240 omar comin '
2241 damn california republicans screwing thing up for everyone else .
2242 `` republicans : good for the economy '' my ass !
2243 i participate in faux slave trading as a hobby .
2244 wow , maybe seattle voters will start electing democrats so they can clean that police force up .
2245 the first part of this article 's title is classic : * proapaganda tool sarah * unfortunately , sarah is too dumb to know what 3 of those words mean .
2246 i mean she is a witch .
2247 i 'm just going to extend this circlejerk arc to a full circle : because there are dipshits in the comments section of the npr site , npr handled the juan williams situation perfectly .
2248 nice try , terrorists ...
2249 duh , the jews have all the $ $
2250 he must be against the slaughtering of palestinians .
2251 considering the atrocities the copts have suffered at the hands of their muslim countrymen i 'm impressed with their willingness to turn the other cheek .
2252 it 's what they do * instead * of paying taxes .
2253 but but but clinton 's penis !

2272 nothing demonstrates love of all god 's children or offers a sign of peace like a firearm .
2273 yeah , that 'll work .
2274 clearly he did n't cut enough of the budget .
2275 this must be what paul ryan was talking about when he was referring to takers as opposed to makers .
2276 i guess they should n't have been driving around in a truck that looks nothing like the fugitive 's .
2277 i am pretty sure that is not going to happen .
2278 i am seriously considering a run for sheriff of la county next term .
2279 truly a well known and respected information outlet .

2284 but they are a reliable source when it comes to the economy , gun control , etc .
2285 all republicans over time have caused every bad thing to happen to us .. even hitler
2286 much better to keep the lowest earners below the poverty line to make sure it 's convenient for the rest of us amirite ?

2305 whatever happened to good , wholesome readings like `` 1984 '' and `` brave new world '' ?
2306 what about the poorest cities ?
2307 why not yellow ?
2308 what did this accomplish for the gop , either for the country or for them ?
2309 thanks , but i 'll wait for the unskewed version of this poll .
2310 the leader of the party with big ideas !
2311 hundreds , hundreds to be investigated , and that is breathtaking , now is n't it .
2312 so difficult to imagine a republican lying about the aca .
2313 i wonder if it 's related to the fact that people actually had to sign up for something by now .
2314 they can marry anyone they want as long as they 're the same race so it 's not discrimination .
2315 i 'm sure the politicians wo n't have any problem turning down more money when they realize the people want them to .
2316 as a director of halliburton at the time , it would be a breach of cheney 's fiduciary duty not to .
2317 when will these individuals with mental illnesses start taking * personal responsibility * for their condition , and stop expecting the state and the taxpayers to nanny them ?
2318 i was always taught that being mississippi was illegal .
2319 people who point out gop racism are racist too !
2320 democrat math .
2321 sensible plan , make san francisco as uninhabitable as all large cities .
2322 well that 's what happens when you have a republican house and a democrat senate i guess
2323 nah , both parties are the same , voting is a sham , ds and rs are equally bad .
2324 pics or it did n't happen .
2325 ... more than once .
2326 you try to do the right thing , and everyone still has their hand in your pocket .
2327 that may be the only thing that would stop it .
2328 remember , you are living in a post racial world , so this is obviously a lie .
2329 what a dumbass
2330 now you can blame congress if you are accused of date rape .
2331 unintended consequences
2332 that 's shitty movie level of convenience .
2333 so basically the margin of error .
2334 quick , everybody download some terrorism before they get it back up !
2335 well shut up do n't let the terrorists find out
2336 i love when a man tells women how women feel .
2337 it 's good that they mentioned it 's a soccer mom , it just goes to show that the police are way off base

2339 lol , k
2340 clearly the team owner contributed more to walker 's campaign than the university .
2341 bobby jindal - stuck on stupid .
2342 in my opinion , those young people should at least get employed in the scientific field or a stem-powered occupation if they can .
2343 well , those elderly people probably went through the great depression , so they already got some practice !
2344 way to go dude , clearly representing what the people want there .
2345 well of course fracking poses a risk to drinking water ... if fracking is so good why do they advertize how wonderful it is ?
2346 fixing it would ruin all the hard work the republicans have done
2347 no shit - it 's probably just liberal propaganda data though
2348 trump poll numbers : as great as his business acumen
2349 they are making an example out of her , but i do n't think it 's the example they 're going for ...
2350 snarky comment : there 's no such thing as a simple tax return .
2351 if only we had more guns ... we could be like the middle east , or pakistan .
2352 corporations are people though
2353 that 's true , we all deserve better than bush , a person who 's not even declared his candidacy and it 's already dead in the water .
2354 but there is so much less to talk about that way .
2355 i only listen to the weather channel when it tells me my weather forecast
2356 but `` both parties are the same '' , huh ?
2357 students suggest that chris christie shut the f * * * up .
2358 good
2359 cause we all know that recessions are caused by poor people and their credit default swaps .
2360 whoa , what party ?
2361 'illegal aliens never break any laws ' - enlightened leftist
2362 he 's not even president yet and he is already creating jobs !
2363 newfangled pope from the new world , i guess i can wait until another old world pope comes along to correct .
2364 racist , white supremacist patches on his jacket but surely this was an attack on faith and christians !
2365 i 'm confident that had it been illegal to own a gun , this guy would have totally not committed 9 murders .
2366 i guess he won then .
2367 definitely atheism .
2368 remember white collar crime is n't real crime .
2369 it 's not terrorism cuz those damn muslims did n't do it .
2370 yea , why did n't that woman in her 70s go ninja on him ?
2371 obamatrade supported by most republicans and far too many democrats .
2372 what better way to prove that we need healthcare reform than by putting tons of people in the hospital ?
2373 translation : where are our damn checks ?
2374 clearly you realize this is the first step in the march towards the inevitable government mandated chemical castration of `` undesirables '' wake up sheeple .
2375 the states ' rights to have slaves .
2376 public opinion should never be law
2377 well when couples start having their weddings in other counties the ensuing loss of business will soon change their minds .
2378 how do guys like ted cruz stand themselves ?
2379 pearl harbor , the cuban missile crisis , the kennedy coup d'etat , all just blips .
2380 everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant !
2381 sounds like a brilliant campaign strategy to me .
2382 cruz does not understand the plot of green eggs and ham .
2383 see , it 's not racist at all !
2384 i honestly ca n't remember a single ( positive ) thing that bush ever did for this country .. this man is going to have a legacy
2385 nothing will cheapen your argument more than the kkk being on your side .
2386 good , this is the proper way to handle it if you simply refuse to do your job over it .
2387 is that what the rich do , file frivolous lawsuits ?
2388 how many wars have hillary , bill , or obama served in ?
2389 this was actually taken before the khan comments so i suspect that this will look even worse for trump next week .
2390 thank you for this hard hitting journalism .
2391 and sadly his supporters love him for it .
2392 the must really make the bernie sanders supporters upset that clinton is committed to a liberal supreme court .
2393 because he 's honest , and is a straight shooter !
2394 7d pokemon-go
2395 he means `` crack one off ''
2396 anybody have a link to oliver 's rant which is available to international viewers ?
2397 shocking ... just shocking
2398 comey is obviously russian .
2399 the `` fat '' in the title is really what convinced me of her hypocrisy .
2400 the general election has never been rigged before , absolutely never
2401 battery glitch .
2402 damn dude you are spamming this page right now lol
2403 but the dnc is a private entity so they can do whatever they want
2404 but its a moral disaster !
2405 surprised this post was n't deleted for `` incorrect title ''
2406 this khan thing sure has worked out great for trump , keep fucking that chicken !
2407 no i 'm positive that she said `` we 'll raise taxes on the middle class '' and got an applause break .
2408 this must be one of those phony polls
2409 i 'm thankful for his son 's service .
2410 hillary clinton and obama were also responsible for the japanese attack on pearl harbor , which occurred before either of them were born .
2411 i would be impressed if don wins four states .
2412 i ca n't imagine why democrats would want to make it so illegals and people on temporary visas can easily vote .
2413 oh , that 's right , trump is the warhawk .
2414 my blood runs cold .
2415 got to pitch for that koch money .
2416 sampling error : +/-7 % .
2417 ben carson should travel back in time to may 2015 and kill himself .
2418 but liberals are the real racists !
2419 it 's the media , all media is liberal , that 's why they call it the liberal media !
2420 house of cards
2421 that 's so gay
2422 anyone that says anything bad about this article is a shill !
2423 i do n't understand , reddit told me that hillary got a negative convention bump and that trump had nowhere to go but up .
2424 illegal immigration *
2425 are people seriously not understanding that when donald trump says immigrants/undocumented works , what he really means is muslims and mexicans ?
2426 it 's well documented that a money could outperform most stock market investors so this is not news .
2427 i did n't realize that trump will be dropping out so soon .
2428 just like bill , that will destroy the economy and drive up deficits , just like bill
2429 please stop with the attacks , melania is white , rules do n't apply to white immigrants .
2430 itt : trump supporters who think railing against one of the most successful presidents will help out .
2431 her internal polling must be looking pretty terrible , finally
2432 take it up with cheney and bush .
2433 the primaries were
2434 how about we let the republicans decide their own primary ?
2435 he 's one of the good ones !
2436 what a diverse list of blue collar people that have always been about the worker and against our trade deals .
2437 i mean he 's not wrong
2438 i would think we 'd want to keep the federal government away from federal elections as much as possible .
2439 cause that will prevent the clintons
2440 well , the cia seem concerned that he may be an agent of putin 's russia , and they are not averse to assassinating people .
2441 what a joke , the fact that he is n't leading by more than 66 points shows he 's a horribly weak candidate .
2442 because hillary and the media says we do .
2443 everyone should pat their own god damn bills .
2444 well .......... she did .
2445 yes , a 54 % approval rating of obama will be what prevents trump from being elected .
2446 i do so enjoy watching my generation be the whipping boy for the media and american politics .
2447 liberal shill .... oh wait
2448 she would get an abortion , and it would be a moral abortion , because , as many prolife people will tell you , the * only * moral abortion was their abortion .
2449 true , but that 's a personal choice to make , since it 's an anticipated burden , and if a parent feels that they are not willing to deal with such a hardship and are within the first trimester ( or the legal period for abortions ) of their pregnancy , let them make that choice .
2450 i would love for this creepy little man to stay out of my uterus .
2451 oh gee , what a nice moderate republican he is .
2452 obviously we need to unskew this poll , stat .
2453 but all the trump supporters said the post-convention bounce was over ?
2454 you 're not supposed to accept handouts you communist fuck .
2455 we are legion
2456 nope , this is still a convention bump .
2457 yup , you caught me
2458 ah cnn , the most reputable and un-biased of news sources
2459 but ... but jobs are seasonal in july !
2460 that is n't that many people .
2461 because you know , conservatives are known for their particularly peaceful ways .
2462 i mean ... he 's right to try and link them .
2463 totally sure trump is quaking in his boots .
2464 hahahahahahaha !
2465 another hilarious trump joke
2466 the great unfriending of 2016
2467 and it would only take 1 second amendment folk-person to stop trump .
2468 the second amendment was intended to avoid having to maintain a standing army .
2469 13 articles in this sub 's first 2 pages ... should n't we make a megathread to organize this properly ?
2470 so presidential .
2471 yea lets remove whats left of accountability with political contributions .
2472 far cry from the 'trump will rip hillary apart in the debates ' attitude of just a couple months ago
2473 that 's a shocker .
2474 is n't hillary bffs with a former grand wizard ?
2475 that 's certainly on the same level as winking to your supporters that they should shoot your opponent if she wins .
2476 but he speaks his mind , that 's why he 's great !
2477 unfortunately this will do little to tarnish hillary 's approval right now amidst the befuddlement of the donald with his remarks from yesterday .
2478 good luck .
2479 first time ive ever agreed with trump lmao
2480 how could someone ( secret service or not ) just idly use their key to turn off an elevator then not know what happened ?
2481 oh right , that six-figure clinton foundation payment that totally exists and definitely was not an easily discredited scam .
2482 but the secret service are obviously paid schills that are just doing hillary 's bidding right now , right guys ?
2483 people with npd do it because they think they are much smarter than you , and you are an idiot that will believe them .
2484 correcting intensifies .
2485 this article is misleading because trump said they founded isis , not isil .
2486 the wealthiest americans have all the political representation but none of the taxation .
2487 good .
2488 yeah he said `` leave iraq '' , not `` leave iraq and pour more weapons into ksa while ignoring their nuclear ambitions with pakistan , and then shit all over syria and libya while winking to iran ''
2489 he might not have been the founder , but he sure did give it plenty of food and water and room to grow .
2490 jesus that little ?
2491 hey now you ca n't call him a fascist until he kills at least 15000 people and then mayyybe we can use that word
2492 no it 's ironically .
2493 of course there is , he paid his employees and they paid for child care .
2494 what a crooked evil whore .
2495 thanks obama
2496 did she mentioned how is she paying the $ hills on reddit ?
2497 so wait they would get actual trials under trump ?
2498 remember that time she lied to you
2499 nice to see that `` emergency meeting '' with the rnc heads mellowed donald so much
2500 yeah but like , it 's her turn .
2501 bernie has never been right before , he 's wrong here too .
2502 did you know that obama founded afghanistan ?
2503 probably paid for by funds from the u.s .
2504 do n't worry , there 's none left to vote .
2505 the times should preempt cheeto and stop covering his loser rallies
2506 it 's sad what the goppers are doing to them .
2507 obviously nothing could be his fault .
2508 they have keep a record of every person who received a haircut for 20 years and/or turn that record over to the atf when they close their business ?
2509 third party candidates are disruptive to the narrative and only serve to confuse people who want to think they really have options .
2510 no , you see , that 8th year of w 's term , that was really the result of clinton destruction of the economy .
2511 trump is a mess .
2512 maybe he could ask obama to disband it .
2513 i like to see the faces of the minority that will vote for hillary , when trump finally is elected president of the us of a and you guys have finally reached the point of no return .
2514 and clinton must disclose her pro-saudi arabia ties .
2515 how did clinton spin accepting donations from russia while selling uranium mines to a state owned firm named armz .
2516 our saudi friends do n't count as part of `` radical islamic terror '' , i guess .
2517 might as well stay home and not vote then am i right
2518 i prefer mayors who do n't let their city get attacked by terrorists .
2519 ... and people believed him .
2520 so many things this year that shouldnt even require politifact to chime in -.-
2521 come on guys , everyone knows obama was president from 2000 to 2016
2522 `` i believe '' , `` i believe '' , `` i believe '' no cites , no sources and it 's just gospel to his brain dead acolytes , bring up something questioning trump with sources and cites to these same acolytes and they just dismiss it .
2523 never trust anyone who wears wooden shoes !
2524 they want to ensure there is n't a protest vote for a 3rd party against what clinton stands for .... because it risks trump .
2525 another corrupt democrat .
2526 nah .
2527 guise your helping clinton by posting this !
2528 supports my wikitroll theory
2529 nah , he 's just gon na live tweet the entire briefing .
2530 you do n't think they 'll like his `` spin around and show me whatcha got '' platform ?
2531 must have been hillary 's * liberrrruhl mind beams * that made him say that .
2532 that 's because they 're lazy
2533 trump is uncoachable .
2534 damn liberal media .
2535 i 'm sure this will clear everything up and clip any loose ends and finally end the clinton corruption allegations ( whether true or not , not making that statement here ) .
2536 this was all bullshit yesterday , but i 'm sure it 's completely legit today .
2537 but bill is n't running for president !
2538 i 'm sure clinton is reassured to hear that .
2539 woah , i never thought i would see news of trump being hypocritical .
2540 but not in america .
2541 well as long as reasonable people are in charge .
2542 just stopped in to say fuck chris christie ...
2543 no takesies backsies .
2544 hey if all the healthcare companies merge , then we 'll have only one option left , right ?
2545 she 's probably a secret muslim .
2546 owned by the good ol ' charles koch foundation
2547 fuck the politicians who continue to support arresting citizens for dried flowers
2548 so what exactly would an unhealthy campaign look like ?
2549 `` but i sure as hell can cash his checks ! ''
2550 just like you 're not paying attention to what he actually said ?
2551 it 's clear , if hillary loses north carolina it must have been because she was cheated .
2552 good job texas .
2553 both parties are the same
2554 they also said they ca n't confirm or deny that hilary matched trumps donation dollar for dollar
2555 but what about all those european countries that are undergoing massive waves of protests to switch to a healthcare system like ours ?
2556 it really all depends , on which candidate wears them .
2557 'deep in the dumb of texas ''
2558 what poll ?
2559 yes the hate filled , racist , misogynistic , xenophobic , etc. , wonder is our only hope .
2560 i too support candidates who disrupt rescue and relief efforts for a photo op !
2561 political prosecution at it 's finest .
2562 the key word here is `` if '' .
2563 does it have anything to do with the anti-semite that is in charge of his campaign ?
2564 dead mothers , too .
2565 better let the women kill their own babies
2566 maybe his zoloft dosage is a little off .
2567 another unbiased , reputable source .
2568 soooooo ..... the laws are working ?
2569 i ca n't believe that some people say this sub has gone to shit .
2570 i ca n't wait to hear how she 's honoring her small dollar donors over large corporate lobbyists .
2571 yeah well , he gives such a compelling reason for us to like him
2572 the gang 's all here .
2573 hillary does not lie with every breath - she also coughs at times !
2574 i do n't think michelle bachman is a foreign policy guru , maybe i 'm mistaken
2575 this ca n't possibly go wrong .
2576 if you claim that you have real issues with voting for clinton you 're a petulant child who wants to burn everything to the ground because you did n't get what you want .
2577 but we have to unscrew the polls to know whats really going on .
2578 just fyi these emails were already reviewed by the fbi before comey announced that there would be no indictment .
2579 i am thoroughly disappointed in trump .
2580 nothing like the clinton foundation
2581 at this point i 'm just going to assume that anyone who signs on with trump is actually signing up to be a talking head analyst on the trump news network .
2582 throw up another w for `` the real americans ''
2583 did n't ask for sand ( y ) bags and now they 're surprised the flood is a problem ?
2584 but i thought trumpetes hated safe spaces !
2585 do n't worry , he 's winning
2586 he 's not too worried , in 2020 he 'll have 95 % of the black vote so no biggie
2587 but i was just in va and saw * so many * trump signs !
2588 any chance the clinton 's have more money than trump ?
2589 because he met a cop who said he could , duh .
2590 that african american outreach looks to be going great !
2591 how about saudi donations to clinton or the israel lobby ?
2592 the orcs have developed a strategy
2593 but all polls are skewed and rigged except that one poll from the la times !
2594 so weak , so sad .
2595 bush 's fault .
2596 too bad we do n't have any tape of all the crazy shit he 's been saying for the past two years .
2597 hillary clinton will withstand these baseless accusations , the same way she withstood manufactured scandals from republicans for over 25 years
2598 if only we could keep blacks , browns and women from voting we would n't have to be concerned .
2599 i imagine the first draft said something about trump having an extraordinarily large penis and normal sized hands .
2600 she sure can break down barriers .... between donor and politician and all kinds of other barriers too
2601 this is a revolution .
2602 i am sure this will be highly upvoted
2603 is ann coulter msm now since she is unfairly portraying trump as flip flopping ?
2604 by estimating the crowd size i can tell trump went up +15 points nationally and i did n't even include lawn signs !
2605 it was the interest on that 400mill
2606 if the stenographers in our `` newsrooms '' could stop publishing the assange is a rapist hit pieces and actually do their jobs we would n't need wikileaks ... of course , they 're too well paid to even think of rocking the boat .
2607 says who ?
2608 we 'd better get assange working then
2609 i guess he does n't want any votes then .
2610 it could be el cheeto yelling at his magic 8-ball .
2611 but he 's white and republican so he 's not the problem .
2612 this is not news
2613 it 's not his fault that common sense has a liberal bias !
2614 nothing says smaller government like more taxes !
2615 nah , it 's all a conspiracy by the clinton campaign to win the presidency and force us all to get microchips implanted into our butts .
2616 by removing dbe favors from government entities like restaurants at airports , for example .
2617 this will definitely convince all of rush limbaugh 's audience not to vote for clinton , i 'm sure at least 50 % of them were planning on doing so .
2618 she 's not a racist , she 's a 'racial realist ' i mean , * is she wrong * ?
2619 trump knows how to pick 'em !
2620 something he learned from john mccain ?
2621 omg ur so funy nd inlitened .
2622 prostitution and pot is legal and they do n't have a military , so i 'm thinking it 's an actual hell hole .
2623 finally , those leaks will lead us to the fire !
2624 marijuana is only bad when minorities smoke it ...
2625 this sounds like a well researched , fact based article .
2626 his respect for women is the greatest respect !

2635 it 's all god 's plan .
2636 nice try hillary .
2637 who 's going to scoop up this steaming pile ?
2638 `` let the dataset change your mindset '' its all in the numbers , but people are afraid of truth .

2644 but nigel farage was in mississippi !
2645 but but but .... i thought she said she did n't delete any work related emails !
2646 simpsons did it .
2647 thank god that muslims do n't have airplanes .
2648 add prisons to that list .
2649 why does she need so much money against a guy who is barely running ads ?
2650 never trust any huckster that used god to prop up their viewpoint .
2651 but all republicans are still evil mouth breathers
2652 yeah , if you get raped , you 're weak and do n't deserve to be welcomed into the future of this nation !
2653 maybe it should be in front of a burning car ...
2654 thanks kasich
2655 holy mother of sweet baby jesus , scalia 's passing saved democracy in nc .
2656 democrats use cheat sheets , trump supporters use white sheets .
2657 13:45 ... effing awesome , `` get the f off my phone '' .
2658 that 's the liberal media for you .
2659 nice to see that the criminal justice system is being so awesome to the perps and protective of the victims and general population
2660 if i was chris i might actually have to really consider exercising that right actually .
2661 journalism at its finest ladies and gentlemen !
2662 not to worry , we 're printing more .
2663 because of course illegal aliens are in state residents and deserve it .
2664 hm ... because liberals run the media ?
2665 the terrorists won years ago , we 've been living in a state of terror for 11 years now

2668 fuck ron paul and his consistent pursuit of common sense to solve issues .
2669 better get used to praying -- whether you 're a believer or not .
2670 when the rich leaves america , the country 's just going to sink and drown .
2671 you also conveniently forget that there is no national sales tax .
2672 warren buffet 's company has n't paid taxes for the past 8 years .
2673 this just goes to show that both sides are only concerned with politics -- not what is right or wrong .
2674 `` thank you for your sacrifice and service . ''
2675 humanity ... still not even close to crawling out of the dark age .
2676 lobbying congress and giving politicians is fine but if those motherfuckers shutdown a private website for private reasons it 's abuse .
2677 while this is pretty damning , i think it gets us all considering what would happen if abc news sat down for an extended on-camera interview with our ex .
2678 i think president obama is probably right about that .
2679 chriss dodd is just a believer in the ancient definition of `` a honest politician is one who once bought will stay bought '' .
2680 topical and radical !
2681 my ~~santorum~~ semen saturated excrement that glistens pale with with lube in the moonlight also endorses chuck norris .
2682 i 'm sure the doj will go after them right after they finish with the bankers .
2683 is n't capitalism great ?
2684 effective politics requires maturity and patience .
2685 and this surprises anyone ?
2686 shocker
2687 misleading title is misleading .
2688 i 'm waiting for private businesses to step in and provide air traffic control .
2689 and absolutely none of it is obama 's fault !
2690 there they go legislating vaginas again .
2691 the federal government already does this , why not the states ?
2692 what do you expect when the most liberal president ever in exsistence is elected to implement a radical liberal agenda and allow workers to control the modes of production as obama obviously is doing .
2693 clearly this is part of obama 's socialist agenda
2694 todo : buy more popcorn .
2695 impossible , they are pushing a drone fuelled police state !
2696 smh # whereisobamaof2007 ?
2697 children must not be allowed to learn any fact based information .
2698 way to go lapd , surely this will improve your public image .
2699 obviously if jesus was a counselor he would send all of the lgbt , sexually active students and jews to hell .
2700 it 's a sad state of the country when something this true is n't even being discussed .
2701 but ... but ... but ... socialism !
2702 right about now is a great time to invest in companies who manufacture ammo clips with * one round less * than the legal limit !
2703 gaffe : when a politician accidentally tells the truth
2704 finally , somebody willing to stand up to all those women in poverty !
2705 republicans will obstruct until 2016. full stop .
2706 itt : a lot of idiot conservatards downvoting the truth .
2707 it 's a beautiful day in the neighborhood , can you say unconstitutional ?
2708 there are many government funding programs that could be cut without hurting anyone , probably enough to cover that $ 85,000,000,000 .
2709 affordable healthcare payed keeps the coat hangers away !
2710 it does n't , because it is full of shit and will never be passed .
2711 but ... but ... but ... socialism !
2712 i have neither the time nor the technical skill to do this , but i 've always hoped that someone could generate a running total of apologies , from republicans compared to democrats .
2713 the thought of two penises near each other makes fred very .... very excited .
2714 kind of like how democrats only care about war and human rights when republicans are in power ?
2715 i am sure the daily caller had nothing to do with it
2716 damn faggots ruin everything
2717 you mean the prosperity of unregulated capitalism dyed the waters red , white and blue for 'merica !
2718 well in that case i guess we better start gearing up to invade north korea , sudan , iran , chad , uzbekistan , and zimbabwe .
2719 wow such a profound statement .
2720 spoiler alert , she 's getting elected .
2721 it 's still more money : p
2722 um yeah , because obama was a muslim .
2723 i read the title as 'pirate prision ' article was n't as exciting as i thought it would be
2724 y'all got ta problem with that ?
2725 in fairness , i 'm sure that the application for firearm purchase and background check will also ask if people want to register to vote
2726 so , should we do away with divorce and force the parents to stay together until the child is at least 18 ?
2727 which makes so much sense !
2728 i 'm so glad the the iraq war only took slightly more than a month before it was all over and our fearless leader could declare `` mission accomplished ! ''
2729 i 'm sure that 's an exact quote .
2730 someones got to foot the bill to reward our hardest workers !
2731 but only in red states
2732 finally - some job creation ; someone 's got ta build those camps .
2733 only on reddit would a holocaust denial website be on the frontpage ...
2734 the word 'formality ' comes to mind .
2735 i bet it 's alabama or something ... click link nailed it !
2736 who cares ?
2737 but the gop is n't racist !
2738 just another example of how big government liberals are pushing private business out of the market .
2739 republicans need more time to impeach obama , he will give them 4 more years to try .
2740 wow what great camera work , eh ?
2741 1 civil war , was not enough , we have boys to spare !
2742 now if we could only find that one thing that will turn everyone straight .
2743 well * that * was totally unexpected .
2744 if you are an attractive woman there will always be a position open for you at the weed store at the front desk .
2745 considering i have to pay extra for my luggage , it 's nice that they do n't charge me for the molestation .
2746 this article is not journalism .
2747 censorship is so patriotic and conservative .
2748 unlike for-profit healthcare with a 40 year record of * always * putting the needs of patients first .
2749 ... but fuck the unemployed , they 're just lazy people who want unearned money !
2750 reddit rejoices !
2751 because the lapd is well known for their level of discretion .
2752 obama , what a sellout !
2753 so , basically nothing ?
2754 it was such a wholesome flag before it was hijacked
2755 can we keep civil forfeiture in place but only for the real drug dealers .
2756 republicans will reach out alright , with the back of a hand .
2757 bomb 'em !
2758 they just need to man up and pull themselves up by their bootstraps .
2759 shows you just how dumb the former is , and how it is good that everyone isnt that stupid .
2760 yeah , it is limited to christianity .
2761 shit , let 's wait to see how the next article says he really wanted to use an ar15 .
2762 because our lives are none of his damned business .
2763 while we 're at it , let 's bring back child labor .
2764 til donald trump does n't know that hawaii is part of the us .
2765 politico means the koch brothers announced their presidential bid .
2766 i just do n't see how this is possible in a post-racial , post-obama world
2767 perhaps if they turned the executions into televised pay-per-view events , they could recoup some of their expenditures .
2768 they have to be housed separately and the appeals process is costly and can drag on for decades .
2769 sieg heil !
2770 i 'm surprised he 's not an expert on the military considering his proud history of military service to our great country .
2771 even a broken clock is right twice a day .
2772 do n't forget `` bobby '' jindahl .
2773 why are conservatives so fiscally irresponsible ?
2774 this goes well with the other nicknames to the list : bobby `` stupid party '' jindal , tom `` tehran '' cotton , james `` senator snowball '' inhofe , .. there 's a whole lot to work with , ca n't wait to see the list grow with ... trump will be a fun one .
2775 good
2776 something something lame duck president .
2777 yes , trump has revealed the hidden racism in the republican base
2778 ca n't we just keep having pizza delivered to his house until he does n't exist anymore ?
2779 they could disrupt the stability that the us and her allies have brought to the region .
2780 lol finally
2781 success !
2782 c'mon guys , this 60 year old man could have just as easily killed those people with a knife or a car .
2783 do n't forget they can crash out markets .
2784 oh no look at the police state of america with their lack of freedom -_-
2785 stop oppressing my freedom of religion !
2786 this worked so well when george w. bush put his college buddy in charge of fema .
2787 dems already planting the seeds of fraud to cover for hillary 's loss
2788 christ christie is a fat dickhead
2789 an article like this does n't help bernie sanders in the long run .
2790 i just love reddit , it 's where i learn all the secret stuff
2791 glad our tax money was wasted on this non-issue .
2792 i eagerly await huckabee 's plans to send out troops to red lobster to prevent people from eating shellfish and to clothing stores to prevent people from wearing clothes of mixed fabrics .
2793 syria ... libya ... ukraine ... yemen ... thanks obama !
2794 before the aca no one ever went into debt for health care .
2795 totally not a perfect example of the racism inherent in the trump movement that makes ethnic minorities think that other candidates are a better path for america
2796 trump youth !
2797 here comes all that voter fraud !
2798 if elected `` trump declares war '' will probably be way too common of a headline
2799 if we are to have a serious discussion can we get a serious link ?
2800 how shocking that the grand bigot party hates gays , hispanics , blacks ...
2801 reply gunning for the harambe vote there .
2802 `` if you vote for me i will do things i should have been doing for over a year on the campaign trail '' `` she 's the best candidate , so transparent , i 'm with her ''
2803 hillary clinton is basically dick cheney in a pantsuit .
2804 this is definitely a quality that i look for in a president
2805 jingoist .
2806 probably not infused with small pox .... but it 's been a weird election
2807 deadbeat donald would n't have to do his own dancing if he paid the `` usa freedom kids '' what he owed .
2808 but you 're white , so you must be a racist .
2809 yeah , i 'm sure he would have
2810 lul please , tell me how ?
2811 bernie sanders campaign has been relegated to the trashbin of history , it 's hardly a surprise the trumps would go dumpster diving for some stale attacks .
2812 so we 'd be safe ?
2813 that 's what i like to see , my tax dollars going to an ill-conceived attack on physics ...
2814 $ hill must be chocking on all that bull sh ! t she has been spewing on campaign
2815 see , trump really does get the best people .
2816 maybe some press conferences would be a healthy break
2817 because we all know destroying old mobile devices erases emails .
2818 and definitely just a coincidence .
2819 i 'm certain you would n't be whining about clinton not following standard it security protocols if she had n't properly wiped her hdds and destroyed her mobile devices before disposal .
2820 yeah , sending troops to syria , leaving troops in iraq and sending them to libya all in order to steal oil totally is n't starting new wars !
2821 blame her lawyer .
2822 i 'm sure they 've both deleted some emails , so we can assume there is proof in there .
2823 i would take trump any day over that corrupt cow .
2824 the pot calling the kettle black lol .
2825 sure , trump is a moron but there is no one else more qualified .
2826 i love the smell of dead american soldiers in the morning .
2827 this should be an attack ad in every downballot dem race : republicans put the confederate flag and defunding planned parenthood over fighting zika make it clear the the republican rot runs deep
2828 because having your isp end up being run like the flint water utility is a * great * idea .
2829 god damn political correctness
2830 this fucking guy .
2831 judicial watch are having an angry cry today .
2832 what is hillary doing , her team needs to blow this up
2833 right , because how could that go wrong ?
2834 what a pos .
2835 this is grave
2836 perhaps trump should change mar-a-lago from french to whatever it is in mexican .
2837 if stein can be charged with a misdemeanor she clearly does n't have the connections necessary to be president of the united states .
2838 quick , somebody please correct the record
2839 how very sharia of you donald
2840 establishment grasping at straws ; they are scared .
2841 patriots fans should vote clinton , game recognize game .
2842 he 's too busy working on trump 's eyes ... or whatever
2843 for fucks sake , why is this even a thing ?
2844 well , at least he 's consistent about something .
2845 he did n't answer most of the questions , and the ones he did answer were fill with lies .
2846 ap is so anxious to defeat clinton , they let their veil drop and revealed they are , like fox , just another pr branch of conservative republicans .
2847 someone post the video where cenk punks this racist old crank
2848 damn northern aggression .
2849 i wonder if they realize that trump is leading in trustworthiness , while media are even behind hillary .
2850 thank god they wo n't have to waste that money on education , bridge repairs , or fire response .
2851 elected three times by wisconsin
2852 what a man of the people
2853 because that 's logical and not completely batshit .
2854 but it feeeeeeels worse .
2855 hoo boy , now that 's presidential .
2856 he is not even in the top 10 % with that salary .
2857 who cares , show us trumps .
2858 well , sucks to be the people of dupont .
2859 was she ever behind in recent weeks ?
2860 does n't the us already ignore the geneva convention due to the torture camps ?
2861 for fuck 's sake
2862 hillary clinton fell down so now none of this matters as we are now all forced to vote for trump causing a conservative supreme court which will affect policy longer than any presidential candidate would .
2863 well , from behind , her and trump have the same hair ?
2864 the american people did n't think so it seems .
2865 'pneumonia ' sure , that 's what it is .
2866 machine says no
2867 all doctor 's statements are just campaign pr .
2868 more accurate description is bernie sanders on acid .
2869 applause
2870 well i hope hillary and all her supporters get anal fissures after harambe rapes them
2871 also in other news he did not have a seizure and faint .
2872 the huffington post 's editorial board has been incredible lately .
2873 that 's out of context !
2874 'you know what us southern boys really mean when we say make america great again ? '
2875 well at least he is doing a white people drug .
2876 and once there really was a man on the moon .
2877 i 'm sure the mods are n't gon na censor any more posts or comments .
2878 florida man is slacking off .
2879 when all else fails blame pepe
2880 its ' great to knows the issues are front and center in this election .
2881 that 's so weird , given her track record of total honesty and transparency
2882 2 points if u include 3rd party candidates .
2883 yes ?
2884 thanks obama !
2885 what are you saying , that clinton is falling apart ?
2886 yeah guys , we should vote for the former wal-mart executive who only has $ 800 million dollars instead of a billion , now * that 's * a working class candidate !
2887 his weekly paycheck .
2888 yeah , donald trump will be a great president
2889 nonshocker , the most c u c k e d state in the union that had fucking mitt `` willard '' romney as governor does n't like trump .
2890 they 're also about to attack an herb called kratom that poses no threat at all other than getting people away from their money making opioids .
2891 a letter from an alleged lawyer on the trump payroll - slam-dunk
2892 syrian refugee acceptance into us 99.9 % muslim 0.1 % christian syrian population 90 % muslim 10 % christian that 's a 100:1 degree of discrimination for you progressives keeping track at home .
2893 flu can cause pneumonia , but if that is the case with hillary , bill should have said that because `` clinton has pneumonia '' has been in the headlines for days .
2894 the economy is being rigged to make obama look good .
2895 good , maybe some people are finally realizing that if trump wins the election , it was the media that elected him .
2896 it sure is a good thing colin powell and hillary clinton encrypted their emails because we ca n't read them now .
2897 in which hillarista pretend to care about black people .
2898 yeah fdr was a punk bitch too !
2899 yes , because sanders is very popular outside of the ows crowd .
2900 71 percent liked , sounds about right .
2901 but hillary told me obama was n't swayed by wall street money in all the debates !
2902 but what does ja rule think ?
2903 trump stop following 1920s economic policy that died with hoover
2904 chipotle for everyone !
2905 guy is doing homework the night before it 's due .
2906 ima vote for her , but whenever i see these clips i channel bob from bob 's burgers saying `` so awkward '' .
2907 everybody knows i only stereotype other races and genders when im excited !
2908 ford moving all that production to mexico is hurting plenty of americans .
2909 wow , di n't see that coming .
2910 well i 'm sure the media will be satisfied now and stop hectoring him
2911 because a lot of people think abortion in wrong in [ current year ] ?
2912 its almost like they should have punished the people at the bank instead of the bank itself .
2913 why would a nuclear kuwait , uae , oman , bahrain , saudi arabia , and egypt be a threat to israeli security ?
2914 yeah , because `` it 's her turn ! ''
2915 he did so non ironically too
2916 and stein was so close !
2917 conversely ... 30,000+ shocking things hillary clinton did n't want to give up this election .
2918 chew with your mouth closed .
2919 dear god , how can people take this guy seriously let alone vote for him ?
2920 yet the military is woefully underfunded and we need to increase spending .
2921 surely this time will work
2922 he paused an interview to watch cnn 's coverage of him .
2923 you never know , after all trump and pence say some crazy shit
2924 i 'm sure milo & amp ; amp ; team over at breitbart will be skewering pence for the suggestion that the world must cater to whatever happens to offend him .
2925 the ap
2926 but hillary only wants 12 bucks for the minimum wage , she is a republican , i 'm going to vote johnson , he is closer to bernie in all policies
2927 now i 'm just wondering whom he intends to shoot in the face .
2928 because birth certificates were not a thing when he was born .
2929 so , it was a slow day ?
2930 yeah the dnc picked a horrible candidate .
2931 federal employees breaking federal law .
2932 i think stiglitz only gave him that because there was n't anything lower .
2933 that will help millennials for sure .
2934 this looks like an even better personal blog ; one that masquerades as a commercial publication .
2935 maybe if we allow for police torture things will get better !
2936 these cops should be punished with paid vacation and transfers to another precinct !
2937 if he was so popular , then do explain , why he failed to win his primary ?
2938 yeah berniebros , this is your fault !
2939 there they go throwing the hitler card , this will totally make me vote clinton after seeing trump called hitler for the 70th time
2940 they were very organized after the murder .
2941 polls are now fake again .
2942 has he tried reading the fucking constitution ?
2943 yes , the lifelong new york liberal is going all in to ban abortion .
2944 but hillary coughed , clearly that 's more important !
2945 i 'm willing to bet this ends in nothing happening .
2946 im not convinced until we find a reddit account post that confirns this .
2947 that 's because 81 % of americans are anti-semitic neo nazis .
2948 it 's a good thing all of her scandals are done and there are no more emails or anything left
2949 well , china built a wall , and you do n't see any mexicans running around there do ya ?
2950 another war criminal trusting hillary.the only ones who still dont support her are dick cheney and george bush .
2951 because when i think of hillary , i think of ethics .
2952 right , because until this happened they had the pretense of impartiality .
2953 so then trump right in saying that blacks are worse off now than at any time in recent memory .
2954 is that compared to the irish slaves that outnumbered them or the black slave owners that bred more black slaves ?
2955 this author apparently does n't know what the word `` millennial '' means .
2956 sometimes i think donald trump is just seeing how much childish and immature behavior the american voter will tolerate .
2957 well that 's a good way to win hearts and minds to your cause .
2958 trump surrounds himself with only the best people !
2959 i love that the one black guy has an expression on his face like , `` what the fuck , dude , why did you bring me here ? ''
2960 lois lerner is still laughing about the time darrell issa threatened to jail her .
2961 great endorsement !
2962 mostly i 'm just surprised to learn that i was n't the only jewish gop donor
2963 everyone knows the wall street journal is a liberal rag .
2964 ah , the polls have gone from trustworthy back to skewed in favor of clinton i see
2965 trump knows more than the generals .
2966 so out of convenience , not conviction .
2967 do n't worry , mexico will take care of the debt
2968 so does hillary .
2969 this will be deleted any second now
2970 and the smears start .
2971 yeah jus one of a million reasons not to vote for this conman !
2972 considering it is rump that ordered his people to start this , that is asinine .
2973 wow , the conspiracy is even bigger than we thought .
2974 you know who else did n't drink alcohol ?
2975 it appears the_donald is milking this angle for all it 's worth .
2976 political hack
2977 i 'm sorry nope - hillary clinton has n't been a complete paragon of liberal purity and has n't always supported everything bernie told me that i should support since the beginning of time so i wo n't fall for this blatant pandering
2978 there was no drugs in america before obama .
2979 yes everyone knows african americans ca n't be civilized
2980 how will we ever fix the problem if we do n't stop talking about it ?
2981 of course not , because it makes him uncomfortable when he 's made aware of his privilege , and that 's the * real racism * .
2982 did they have anthony weiner and bill pick the girls ?
2983 sexists
2984 cuz that will calm things down .
2985 shh , let the smart people interpret the numbers for you .
2986 well black unemployment is much much higher under president obama than it was under slavery .
2987 that 's not at all what he said , op .
2988 oh this thread is going to be filled with tons of well argued points from subject experts well versed in law , immunity deals , and everything regarding the case .
2989 standard when conducting a security review .
2990 trump is famous for his humble nature , i 'm sure he just donated the money anonymously .
2991 it 's not that i think she 's wrong , i just really do n't want 4-8 more years of potus involving themselves in local issues like this .
2992 so the electorate can make well informed decisions .
2993 well if kim kardashian is voting for him damn i will too
2994 good .
2995 a few million just about nothings is just about something .
2996 when she leaves the wh next time , she 'll be able to buy chappaqua .
2997 fair or not ?
2998 hillary , ctr , obama , rigged polls , maga
2999 that volume slider violates the geneva protocol .
3000 no one saw this coming .
3001 they waited this long ?
3002 i 'm sure undecided women voters will be very impressed by this .
3003 i guess that makes ted cruz an utterly amoral pathological liar .
3004 the guy who said his tax plan is going to be a tax hike for the wealthy , but instead is actually the largest tax cut for the wealthy in history .
3005 but how can a fantastic business man not be admired by his peers ?
3006 and hillary is the most honorable and honest candidate in human history .
3007 i 'm sure sanders supporters would be gladly supporting clinton-supporters `` protest-voting '' had he won the nomination .
3008 that 's very tolerant of them .
3009 dat post truth politics !
3010 who checks the checker ?
3011 mainly george soros and jim simons .
3012 it just got ten feet taller !
3013 ya , but both candidates are the same !
3014 how very `` presidential '' of him .
3015 unless one of the candidates is absolutely perfect , what 's the point in voting at all ?
3016 of course we need more career politicians .
3017 they 'll be released at 4pm october 7th
3018 is n't that his personal piggy bank anyway ?
3019 big news in the next two minutes !
3020 literally unbelievable
3021 i meant debate , not election : ) .
3022 that 's why we should lower the tax rate -- too many accountants are making money .
3023 why is his taxes an issue ?
3024 no shit dumbass that 's how you win debates .
3025 or you know ... his impeachment .
3026 he was n't upset about her appearance , it was her lack of stamina .
3027 at this point i 'm realizing ... some people just want to watch the world burn
3028 trump has also been accused of rape , sexual assault , bribery , being a coke head , being racist , being xenophobic , not paying people , hiring migrant slaves , supporting global warming , using racist tenant policies , ... i could go one most of those he 's been found guilty on .
3029 down vote - this is a sexist article
3030 biden is just upset he is not as smart as trump , just like the rest of us .
3031 as in 'holding back ' his tears .
3032 this election will really be decided once we have the vice-presidential debates
3033 double-down on the personal attacks , i 'm sure that 'll work for ya .
3034 i heard he has 8th stage super-multiple-parkinsons-sclerosis
3035 so what 's really been going on is that our government failed to adapt as technology progressed
3036 no , when * somebody else does it * that means it 's actually okay !
3037 wrong !
3038 wish she had been hillarys vp pick .
3039 that just proves trump was smart and ahead of his time .
3040 how smart .
3041 i bet she was the second getaway driver and sold crystal meth to middle schoolers and is fat and ugly too .
3042 like a dog that ca n't stop drinking out of the toilet
3043 yeah , explain this to your anti-nafta base , donald .
3044 the `` law & amp ; order candidate '' .
3045 strip clubs do n't have ugly employees and i do n't see have anyone complaining .
3046 what 's ket
3047 what a saint
3048 yes thats what it was
3049 republicans work hard to accomplish nothing .
3050 short term solutions is what 's best for our future !
3051 not to mention because of the electoral college stupidity , less than half a dozen states could even remotely possibly affect results by purely hypothetical voter fraud .
3052 ah yes , because there 's nothing that women these days like more than some good old-fashioned victim blaming .
3053 oh no not the c word
3054 it 's funny how people are taking republican endorsements as if they 're a good thing .
3055 and yet he still won !
3056 to be fair , if these employees did n't follow company culture , none of these problems would have happened
3057 or rather , millions turned off the regular porn for an epic ninety-minute femdom feature .
3058 yeah , he would have had to look chelsea in the eye * then * .
3059 trump has the best people , the best supporters , simply the best .
3060 waka flocka for president
3061 but it 's not about race , because its never about race , right ?
3062 i love how much of an unrelated/non issue bill is , yet he 's obsessively brought up like he is an issue .
3063 no one shames sluts more than other women .
3064 i 'm gon na need some proof
3065 if hillary was accused of the exact same thing they would line up to investigate .
3066 cant we fix this with a taco bowl ?
3067 by the kremlin
3068 and ?
3069 i do n't think i can be surprised of anything this man says anymore .
3070 an old obese man sitting up at 3am watching porn , and tweeting about , is not the image i want in a president .
3071 its not about which candidate would do the best job , its about what supporting them says about me .
3072 and i bet this will be the first time in 2000 years that anything like this has happened to the bible .
3073 i 'm sure jesus has other , more grand plans for her .
3074 very wise to assume one political party can solve all of our problems
3075 it 's amazing that people will continually vote for a party that is * ready and willing * to kowtow to an interest group that is holding the needs of an entire nation hostage .
3076 yes , because a teacher can overcome an entire sub-culture that encourages failure .
3077 if you think that 's what happened , you need to start reading beyond headlines .
3078 in other news : the pope is catholic , bears shit in the woods , and the sky is blue .
3079 it 's a shame he does n't support net neutrality
3080 that damn un , always conspiring to take america down !
3081 funny fact : founding fathers were traitors .
3082 first amendment rights only apply to corporate persons , not real human beings .
3083 ... real satisfaction !
3084 should be called the `` supporting children for the protection of their futures act '' , a la lamar smith .
3085 just remember come november that romney values his capital investment into society so much more than he values your mom 's contribution that he is planning to give further tax breaks to people like him while increasing taxes on people like her .
3086 strange in that 80 % of the deaths in black communities are young black men .
3087 `` knowledge is power ''
3088 men are actually more emotional than women .
3089 wait ... they left out ron paul .
3090 yeah , but that wo n't work over here because we 're am important country .
3091 looks like we need to enforce those gun-free zones in government buildings !
3092 only goes to show that another market correction is long overdue
3093 want
3094 just what the republican party needs to deal with their lack of enthusiasm for any of the current candidates .
3095 seems chris christie should keep his mouth closed more often .
3096 but regulation is the source of all evil in the economy and should be completely done away with !
3097 the product of a welfare state ?
3098 but hes 200 years old he is not as smart as our generation , i mean we have computers !
3099 what a surprise !
3100 do they even listen to themselves when they say these things ?
3101 can we sell them to the chinese ..... ?
3102 i 'm sure the democrats are lined up to voluntarily hand over their incomes to these families in need .
3103 would n't be news if they had n't been white .
3104 of course there wo n't be any conflict ... so long as you only want to own the types of guns they approve of , with the kinds of magazines that they approve of and bought from the people they approve of , all of which is subject to them changing their mind .
3105 they want government just small enough that it can comfortably fit in your bedroom with you .
3106 north carolina is best carolina .
3107 glad to hear that there will be no more crime in ct .
3108 whew , at least someone is thinking of the children !
3109 stay classy aggies .
3110 makes perfect sense , just like all the heterosexual people who do the very same thing all the time .
3111 hope & amp ; change .
3112 has issue with more men than women , ends up killing more women .
3113 but we 've always i been at war with eastasia .
3114 austerity is off to a good start , thanks sequestration .
3115 ban guns !
3116 that is just the dementia talking
3117 ha !
3118 so congress has solved all the more pressing issues facing the american people that they have time for this ?
3119 her childhood of being raised in the most powerful house in the country and attending exclusive private schools , combined with her adult life of living in a multi-million dollar apartment in a very rich area of manhattan , makes her uniquely qualified to both understand and tackle the problems facing the common folk today .
3120 because as we all know , gender is a choice .
3121 i 'm sure the free-market will provide an alternative .
3122 rebranding is useless if nobody wants your product .
3123 lol woops !
3124 you spelled tennessee wrong .
3125 now now , corporations are job creators so if you do background checks ( audits ) before giving them tax benefits and subsidies , they 'd get offended and stop hiring .
3126 up .
3127 hey , going after real criminals is hard work and pretty darn dangerous besides .
3128 yes , america is so third world .
3129 b-but we 're bringing those ungrateful savages freedom ... ?
3130 that 's because the islamic terrorists do n't get `` indicted '' , they get thrown in an mtvr and whisked away to gitmo .
3131 casualties at home = threat to us , legitimizes force/retaliation casualties abroad = apparent weakness in us retaliation , delegitimizes force/retaliation
3132 this has democratic party written all over it .
3133 brilliant !
3134 excel is satan 's tool !
3135 hey buddy , our good ol governor perry needs that money for new boots and a revolver so he can keep playing cowboy .
3136 what a cunt .
3137 that was unpredictable .
3138 well , that will win the gop support of most latino voters .
3139 nice job editorializing the title of the link .
3140 being a senator does not give one any special grace to vote against the position of their constituents to remain in good favor with the gun lobby .
3141 all you people are just clearly exaggerating with your complaints .
3142 from what i understand , a high-school senior does n't have compulsory attendance to high-school ( depending on the state , not sure about mississippi ) , so what the hell was the truancy officer doing trying to corral them ?
3143 do they really expect to win with this type of shit in 2016 ?
3144 seems like an unbiased and totally reasonable source to me .
3145 those evil , good for nothing corporations are just trying to maximize profits !
3146 more subsidized medicine for dead-beats here comes that crazy liberal christie !
3147 but the cuts will be to the corporation and the benefits will be to the people , how unamerican is this ?
3148 right , because children are only cash cows for the state .
3149 if i want news i go to an unbiased source , itar tass from russia comes to mind or xinhua from china .
3150 to go along with the `` cornhusker kickback '' and the `` louisiana purchase '' in the effort to * pass * obamacare .
3151 gop to counter by insisting indians go back where they came from .
3152 yes , since we disagree on his drone policy that mean every other thing he does is wrong .
3153 america responds to obama that he should be ashamed to have not lived up to a single campaign promise , care more about terrorists in other countries than the citizens of his own , and placing gun control over education in his concerns of state .
3154 another republican party hero !
3155 love those entitlements .
3156 john ..... it 's time you retired
3157 if the fetus is viable outside of the womb , why not take it out ?
3158 if the moon was made of spare ribs , would you eat it ?
3159 yeah , like doma
3160 disappointed to see my representative on this list ... i will not be voting for him again .
3161 since this person said that it was about the video , then he obviously ca n't be one of the people behind the attack .
3162 glenn beck is still alive ?
3163 no need to worry , they 're building a new hockey stadium that will take care of everything .
3164 tis but a lie
3165 is this article talking about daschle , clinton , kerry , edwards , reid , schumer , dodd , lieberman , and biden , all of whom voted for the iraq war ?
3166 a bunch of sociopaths ~~running~~ ruining the country
3167 this is n't `` clashing '' in the same sense as when ows `` clashes '' with police , right ?
3168 but its gon na kill jobs , etc
3169 and when the drug war stops and everyone is in driverless cars all that shit is done for .
3170 glad to see the pre-crime unit is in full swing .
3171 and he needs to amp up his racism , it is an important part of that republican outreach program .
3172 he can only have them if he promises to personally read each one himself .
3173 if you like your plan , you 're going to have to change it every year .
3174 it is worth noting that , even after this ruling , the hobby lobby health plan still covers 16 types of birth control .
3175 planned parenthood should give thanks , publicly with quotes , videos , and images of any evidence they have of this .
3176 he does , every 15 minutes
3177 so predictable that it hurts .
3178 both parties are the same
3179 but ... but derrhh stilinn ' arrr vvvaaahhhtsss
3180 i find myself thinking if that episode of `` the good wife '' - do n't make a habit of watching that show , and seeing the end of that episode reminded me why .
3181 interested to hear what bernie supporters have to say about this information , as this directly contradicts what he and his team have been saying for months .
3182 but they ruin property values !
3183 p
3184 more true than false .
3185 i wonder who filed the bogus copyright claim .
3186 this says a lot about our shit courts .
3187 that 's racist !
3188 good
3189 idiots .
3190 just remember kids , bernie has no chance of winning anything , pack it up and forget about it , he 's got no chance , she 's the frontrunner , and there 's just no chance .
3191 i do n't even pay attention to clinton anymore .
3192 i 100 % trust that he will not change his mind again .
3193 how about his raging hypocrisy ?
3194 obviously hitlerally bribed him and this means nothing in regards to her candidacy !
3195 that 's because animals and the environment are n't campaign contributors
3196 it would be so much better if we could just start a few more wars ...
3197 round up camps , door to door shotguns in hand shows your papers mexican !
3198 survey did not include police and professional players unions ?
3199 i do n't remember , what was the deal with the emails again ?
3200 i have said from the beginning that ted cruz is actually running for vice president or a cabinet position .
3201 life in the bible belt .
3202 get the handcuffs out .
3203 gee imagine that
3204 dat sass
3205 so ... really important issues then .
3206 of course they are better ! .... the bible says so !
3207 all of the local news articles fail to mention the word gop or republican for some reason .
3208 and you better believe whatever number trump pulls out of his ass is the correct number because it 's next to impossible to get a number that big out of your ass when your head is blocking the way .
3209 but how will our congressmen support themselves after they 've served their country with such dignity and honor ?
3210 does the gop need to register as a foreign agent ?
3211 because communism .
3212 satan is sending them here , straight from hell !
3213 the best part of hillary 's email scandal is that i 've been hearing 'benghazi ' far less .
3214 scott walker shows he is a statesman , and a man who would , as president , represent the us on the world state with honor .
3215 yes let 's cut off diplomatic ties to a nation of 1 billion that largely influences the global market .... solid idea
3216 yes , we must have a law for this because clearly common sense is not enough .
3217 new york is bigger than the city ?
3218 just because a woman happened to cross the border and give birth in less than 24 hours does n't mean that it 's an anchor baby , i mean how shallow and racist for people to determine that .
3219 lol i 'm sure he 'll tank any day now .
3220 so , he wants to reinterpret the 14th amendment , which would revoke his citizenship , which would make him ineligible for president , which means he ca n't sign the law revoking his citizenship .... it never ends .
3221 allowing money to be back burnered ( deal with it when we need to ) has been so successful in ever other aspect , look how much money we have in the national ~~treasury~~ debt .
3222 20 dead kindergartners did n't sway anyone , why would this ?
3223 can they inform the media of that ?
3224 political censorship of art has such a great tradition in democratic nations , so why not ?
3225 got to stop that mad bernie sanders taking busloads of people over to canada for cheaper medication , it 's hurting our pharmaceutical industry .
3226 he 's naming it after the gmc suv because he 's obviously in the pocket of automakers !
3227 ridiculous exaggerations and sarcasm are effective tools of persuasion .
3228 in 1864 as well , when they were democrats .
3229 3rd times a charm !
3230 what a surprise !
3231 this is going to end well for him .
3232 sex and erotic videotapes oh no .
3233 well it 's hard to argue with that logic .
3234 the bill only harm 's the neoconservative establishment that sucks up to oil princes and wages war on a whim .
3235 has anyone heard trump say something nice about a woman he does n't want to have sex with ?
3236 this could really harm his performance with the radical terrorist demographic .
3237 check out the sex tape !
3238 i hope un deploys international poll observers to ensure free and fair elections
3239 today i learned that lawyer , author , senator , and secretary of state are not real jobs .
3240 trump surrounds himself with the best people !
3241 but it 's hilary using dog whistles !
3242 trump surrounds himself with the best people !
3243 try harder
3244 so is it crazy to think this is actually a big deal for ohio ?
3245 now i have n't read what she said , and have made zero effort to find out , but certain headlines say otherwise , so i 'll disagree with the fact-checker .
3246 forced arbitration is all over the tpp hillary .
3247 easy , he 'd just be smart .
3248 and clinton takes millions from saudis that throw gay people of roofs : ^ )
3249 trump : `` i did business with iranian bank tied to terrorism , i 'm smart . ''
3250 it 's gona kill small business !
3251 `` she 's so mean for making ads of the mean dumb things i 've said ! ''
3252 i missed the part where mark cuban was running for president of the united states on the promise that he 'd fight for blue collar workers .
3253 there 's no proof behind any of it , but it * feels * like it should be right , so let 's run with it .
3254 let 's not jump to conclusions until all the online polls are factored in !
3255 putting on my hip boots , it 's getting real deep .
3256 trump got a purple heart and he did n't get no ptsd !
3257 pure class
3258 but hillary had some meetings with some of the clinton foundation donors , so they 're both the same !
3259 i bet hillary totally has n't done that .
3260 he does have a point .
3261 you 're on it today bravo
3262 hahah oh man americans you guys never fail to crack me up
3263 record requirements for sec compliance .
3264 10d halo and he threw a * lot * of grenades right before he died .
3265 hillary will beat that bill down !
3266 yes , because we all know trump will fix these tax loopholes
3267 its obvious that `` insert democrat '' is better then `` insert republican '' because only `` insert republican '' is a big doo doo head and ctr is paying me good money to say this .
3268 anti-intellectualism is the heart of the gop .
3269 this is gold jerry , pure gold .
3270 what 's up with that 16 % of asians ?
3271 it 's not raciest if you 're privileged .
3272 ... from himself .
3273 sounds like trump is your average politician , the only difference is that all his misdeeds are out in the public .
3274 the old `` anyone who criticizes trump is a shillary '' argument .
3275 let the states handle foreign relations
3276 i ca n't wait until he drops by my state and lectures us about oragon .
3277 only his uninformed followers would .
3278 cnn , a source for information you can trust
3279 obviously this test was created to support hillary by highlighting all of trumps flaws without supporting any of his strengths .
3280 hopefully this makes mccains numbers tank too - it 'd be nice for arizona to get a better senator
3281 sure she first called the storm with her witch powers and then bought adds on the weather channel .
3282 man , it really seemed like they were going trump train .
3283 gay conversion camps !
3284 only because it 's on to the next attention-grabbing issue that 's chosen to be front and center
3285 my people are being treated like our brothers before us , one taco truck for every 3 mexicans
3286 \ # wematter
3287 actually being progressive
3288 black = guilty
3289 volunteer military .
3290 yes , because displacing millions of voters ( in major cities , which usually vote democrat ) in a swing state notorious for messing up elections , is exactly what liberals want to do , a month before an election .
3291 i 'm sure he came to that figure after a thoughtful examination of all existing federal regulations .
3292 i hear their family tree does n't fork either .
3293 how could anyone accuse rick scott of playing gop politics as usual ?
3294 thank god * that 's * cleared up .
3295 it 's almost like he does n't really want to be president or something .
3296 oh , you 're whipping out your muslim thing again just because it just happened was was really stupid ?
3297 itt : ctr shills .
3298 but but but ... there are 96 million toddlers and retired people who are n't working , so that means this is a fake number !
3299 this is why we need a businessman in the white house !
3300 nuclear winter to solve global warming !
3301 the media breathes a heavy sigh of relief and gives themselves a pat on the back for a job well done .
3302 it 's cool , trump has assured us his base loves his strategy .
3303 trump decided he was n't content only getting 1 % or 2 % of the black vote , he needs to get 0 % .
3304 this is n't good , this will just win him more votes among the braindead morons he 's appealing to
3305 i could read the article , but instead i 'm just going to assume these speeches will result in trump winning all 50 states .
3306 i mean , i have the same thing in my own job as a middle manager at a little manufacturing company .
3307 yeah that 's complete fiction ... which is why it 's on a russian tv show .
3308 sad when the aging and demented lashes out ... think your punching days are long gone tough guy .
3309 does it include dead children lying in the rubble of family homes in syria ?
3310 but he still thinks the asshole will make a great president .
3311 oh , that was just locker room banter
3312 what 's that ?
3313 did n't know locker room banter also included talking about one 's daughter like that .
3314 watching the gop implode , knowing it is personally responsible for this clusterfuck , is absolutely delicious .
3315 yeah nobody really thought trump was this bad except kasich
3316 is she qualified based upon her public beliefs , or her private beliefs ?
3317 the basket just got bigger !
3318 'grab them by the pussy ' is just a euphemism for 'taking a woman out to see nice furniture . '
3319 newburyportnews is where i go to get an opinion .
3320 oh so glenn beck 's opinion is suddenly valid among liberal circles ?
3321 in my expierence the media just completely gives up when there 's fresh meat for the taking .
3322 i 'll take `` things everyone saw coming for $ 500 ''
3323 despite bernie 's multiple affairs and history of bragging about sexual assault , like all guys do ?
3324 hours before the final debate , trump will hold a press conference with an investigator who says obama was not born in america .
3325 so , fewer than half .
3326 what i like most about trump is his overweening sense of humility and modesty .
3327 spez for prison
3328 has it been unskewed yet ?
3329 he 's sorry though guys .
3330 i wonder why nobody is doing any polls of trump vs bill clinton ?
3331 someone find this
3332 not according to la times , trump is still up by 3
3333 we must make sacrifices for progress i suppose .
3334 what a travesty
3335 two thoughts : 1 ) obviously he knows there are tapes out there ; and 2 ) why should he change from such a successful strategy
3336 this is news and political ?
3337 please , please make this happen
3338 most trump supporters go to a trump rally just for the chance to sucker punch a black protester .
3339 you messed up now a-aron !
3340 trump must be truly desperate to have gone from kicking toddlers out of his rallies to pretending he can stand the sight of them .
3341 listen to the song at least once before commenting .
3342 i 'm starting to think that trump 's supporters are genuinely confused as to which clinton is running for president .
3343 these republicans that are standing up to him after the 50th thing he said that would 've disqualified anyone else are real profiles in courage .
3344 hillary is so far ahead she 's shilling her books in campaign ads
3345 trump will finally be able to speak his mind , and call hillary a c and obama an n. that will turn this election around !
3346 yeah , save the pussy-grabbing comments for the actual locker room !
3347 hillary 's husband stuck a cigar inside an interns vagina in the white house .
3348 but what about ken bone tho
3349 but the internet told me trump did , and that president ron paul was born in kenya !
3350 raise your hand if you 're surprised
3351 sadman gore
3352 yes we can !
3353 wow , you can count on this not seeing the light of day : /
3354 thats right trump supporters , go and vote november 28 !
3355 remind me to never visit or live in san antonio .
3356 if anyone deserves a break , it 's obama .
3357 is n't she a christian ?
3358 what he actually he said was that he would use campaign money to fund himself .
3359 this is much more important than giving me my $ 27 back .
3360 but he was a democrat then
3361 everyone but white men are defeating donald trump
3362 * '' trump supporter '' * is the new * '' florida man '' * .
3363 now * that * is truly presidential behavior !
3364 locker room banter
3365 i 'm curious how that would flip if men had to announce who they voted for ?
3366 america 's dad .
3367 fortunately they are too old for him
3368 i do n't trust the nose of a demon to detect his own odor .
3369 it 's just a character trait of alpha males .
3370 he is scraping the bottom of the barrel with chisel and there is n't anything left .
3371 heil trump
3372 i thought fema already built those for us ?
3373 so all of a sudden , a month before election , two women say this happened a decade ago with no proof whatsoever , and we 're supposed to just believe them ?
3374 of course they will extend that same courtesy to bill
3375 except clinton 's
3376 wonder why .
3377 i 'm a celebrity listen to me
3378 `` well you see ... bill clinton had several consensual affairs that spanned 2 decades ... i just want to fuck a 10 year old once ... he 's the real monster '' .
3379 only three months to turn the white house into a `` mosk '' and the washington monument into a minaret .
3380 judging on the scowl on both of their faces they have n't even had sex in eight years .
3381 to replace another catholic vp .
3382 i would say that if many of these accusers would have come forward and filed police reports after it happened , we might not be in this mess with a race between a giant douche and a turd sandwich .
3383 guess we shouldnt elect bill
3384 so , different from what he 's already been doing how ?
3385 its takes a pussy grabber to know a pussy grabber .
3386 he 'd have better luck boiling the ocean .
3387 what he does n't understand is hillary 's supporters have been sitting back in their recliners and eating bon-bons for the past month , soaking in the beautiful meltdown happening right before their eyes .
3388 again , not really what she said .
3389 it worked in kansas .
3390 knew that was coming .
3391 we just call them police .
3392 but when * i * do it its doxxing , and i get banned , thanks hitler mods
3393 alpha
3394 his speech certainly sounded a lot of anti-semitic dogwhistles , so it 's not surprising that this happened .
3395 nah , we have mohametan to fall back on , first .
3396 many of whom have been muslim for over a thousand years .
3397 shocking that an abrahamic religion has been in america since george washington
3398 this is ... satire ?
3399 alex jones influence was a lot stronger than i thought it would be .
3400 thanks , obama !
3401 i have yet to meet an open-carrier outside the woods in brown bear country ( and that 's a mixed bag of guns-as-ego-support too ) who is n't a fucking pathetic asshole .
3402 that will really help him .
3403 a star that burns twice as bright only burns for half as long and its light cares nothing for the consent of other bodies .
3404 but he still supports a candidate that violated the embargo ?
3405 radical christian terrorism .
3406 yes , these two things are exactly the same !
3407 because that 's what is happening .
3408 hey , some i assume are good people .
3409 oooh , the scandal !
3410 i would love to hear how you 're gon na do that when you 're on social security
3411 usually an unimpeachable source is the person who started the rumor in the first place .
3412 it 's better to stop 45,000 innocent people from voting than to allow a single fraudulent vote
3413 this is enough to arrest him right ?
3414 i agree .... sexual consent it overrated .
3415 when glenn beck is the voice of reason for the gop ...... what a time to be alive .
3416 paul ryan : i disagree with everything he stands for but he has by total support .
3417 is that suppose to be a scandal ?
3418 i 'm not a racist !
3419 el oh fucking el
3420 because their skin is thinner .
3421 he probably means the republicans , with their policies to make voting difficult for minorities .
3422 damn those journalists and their absolute obsession with reporting every story they come across !
3423 just what we need another liberal , antimilitary , publications against trump .
3424 everyone 's got a right to privacy , unless your name is john podesta !
3425 none of this really matters , the dems will gain this cycle and when the small recession hits in 2-4 years the voters are going to toss them out of power in 2020 leading to a wisconsin/michigan style congressional gerrymandering of epic proportions ensuring gop control of the house forever .
3426 ohh there 's my african american
3427 is the only event hilary doing this month the debate wed ?
3428 dammit .
3429 i mean ... he is .
3430 false flag .
3431 pay no attention to that man behind the curtain
3432 deport him !
3433 i thought martin skreli was the most hated man on the internet .
3434 probably just like the , if not more , insane roller coaster and bombshells they 've put on us this month .
3435 this is weak .
3436 i 'm so surprised that such a respectable outlet as the daily mail would just lie in their headline so blatantly
3437 these must be the animals trump is referring to .
3438 willingness is not an expression of desire .
3439 because assange has absolutely nothing to gain from this .
3440 he 's a bloated failure .
3441 polls do n't mean anything
3442 it 's called `` business ''
3443 but ... but .. only the left is intolerant and violent the_donald
3444 gop congressman : 'thank ~~god~~ putin for wikileaks ' fixed it .
3445 great ground game
3446 it 's just a joke
3447 get your shit together ohio .
3448 i wonder why ?
3449 there 's a big difference between a guy like stern , who 's a bit sleazy and vulgar , and a predator like donald trump .
3450 fire bomb his campaign and get the democrats to pay for the repairs .
3451 i know are n't risotto recipes and campaigns planning for the future not bigger stories than a candidate 's supporters making people so afraid they are fleeing the country !
3452 with some luck he wo n't part of the group that opposes it
3453 if anyone can prove that donald trump does n't objectify women , it 's melania trump .
3454 that makes him smart !
3455 this is absolutely hilarious but clearly false and fake since it reflects negatively on the don ... lol .
3456 now he only needs to get about 60 million more people to vote for him and he wins !
3457 but when guys in white sheets do it , it 's a party
3458 i 'm sure it has nothing at all to do with money .
3459 did n't obama take all their guns ?
3460 who needs email security when you got the russians on your side ?
3461 shockingly ?
3462 wasko is actually quite deplorable .
3463 holy mother of god , the comments in this thread are making it extremely difficult to defend my generation .
3464 and here i was thinking places like the red pill were filled with alpha males
3465 hey donald , you should totally respond to this
3466 so you 're voting for a religious extremist ?
3467 i do n't see what 's so hard to understand ... only the states trump is losing in are rigging the election !
3468 no wonder this article is biased , it 's from the hill .
3469 all of america .
3470 nov 9 is going to be a sunny fucking day .
3471 the clinton rape accusers made some sense but what does trump hope to accomplish with this ?
3472 ffyuu
3473 i am sure it was hillary personally who told them to dump shit in the sewer , not some rented driver who did n't care .
3474 see , the blacks love him !
3475 gee it 'd be a shame we do n't get to see who he 'd invite to sit next to melania at the state of the union every year .
3476 trump supporters are now resorting to literal shitposts
3477 i can hear jesus christ saying those exact words
3478 part of the conspiracy , no doubt .
3479 because the right 's primary electorate was deranged and the field had waaaaayy too many candidates .
3480 i wish kasich would 've gotten the gop nomination
3481 well , why did she wait so long ?
3482 trump getting rekt by his own campaign arm .
3483 today i learned that art pope is a liberal .
3484 hillary in 2013 : `` marriage is between a man and a woman ''
3485 clearly they were clinton plants who were pretending to be white supremacists
3486 you do n't want to give ever a chance to actually cast a vote , do you ?
3487 you 're dad does n't care what you think , woman
3488 clickbait headline = downvote .
3489 segregation now !
3490 his defining moment
3491 did you know that sometimes aborted babies are pushed back into the womb just so they can be aborted again ?
3492 wrong !
3493 this was a rigged poll !
3494 they caught the hacker though so everything is good !
3495 just waiting for videos or leaks to prove trump is right again .
3496 showing he does n't understand that not everyone with a foundation uses it as a personal slush fund .
3497 whoever wins , we still lose .
3498 it is a hack so it must be news !
3499 the number of women who claim they have been groped or assaulted by trump in the past will likely exceed his business credit score by election day .
3500 that 's just stronger evidence that it 's even more rigged , yugely rigged , let me tell you , bigly .
3501 part of the conspiracy obviously .
3502 lol
3503 i dunno if this is on the same level of hillary being called too stupid by the fbi .
3504 to think that hillary had a plant this deep into his campaign this whole time .
3505 i would cheat with her too .
3506 but he does n't support down ballot candidates !
3507 i am absolutely shocked this is on fox .
3508 thank you mother russia for your completely sincere interest in our completely rigged election process .
3509 see , trump is winning battleground states !
3510 i 'm sure all the child rapists are happy about this , they should be expecting pardons based on schilarys past actions .
3511 go back to your sewer .
3512 yes , she should stay behind the scenes and not make a sound unless asked like melania
3513 'this would be like my form of alcoholism ' clearly stating that he is addicted to beautiful women and can not control his urges around them , first step to recovery right ?
3514 but ... but ... poor people are welfare dependent and they have all the time in the world !
3515 i wonder who is downvoting this story .
3516 well fuck minorities build the wall and bomb mecca !
3517 * leans into microphone *
3518 salma hayek is saying all these for her 10 minutes of fame !
3519 `` a rose by any other name would smell as sweet ''
3520 `` ... all of them ... ''
3521 he was talking about the arm rests thing , i 'm sure
3522 climate change isnt real .... putin is .
3523 he 'll be in court anyway , testifying in his child rape case , so this is more of a time-saver .
3524 petty vindictiveness is very presidential !
3525 you forgot his bitchin ' bong , cause you know , bongs are like , $ 20 .
3526 so we finally get people to largely stop smoking cigarettes and now we want them to smoke weed ?
3527 schizophrenia
3528 bullshit shoveler ?
3529 im pretty sure i saw her blinking sos .
3530 after the last check clears , or he treats her like other contractors and does n't pay her .
3531 gon na be honest here , as a regular reader : there was absolutely no way i saw this coming .
3532 but ... but crowd sizes , shit polls , ashamed voters and podesta emails .
3533 build a sea and air wall , duuuh
3534 but mexico is gon na pay for it !
3535 we all know that underinflated footballs are a much bigger threat to the integrity of the game than players who beat their wives and girlfriends .
3536 does n't he also consume the blood of young people for anti-aging purposes ?
3537 because no one ever threatens trump
3538 that makes her smart !
3539 those hackers at wikipedia are always up to no good .
3540 you can make yourself sound really impressive if you just make shit up .
3541 if we played the `` flip-flop '' game on both of these candidates they would both earn medals .
3542 if it does n't include a alien culture wiping out both coasts ala independence day , it is not realistic .
3543 the fact that anybody is going to vote for either candidate is the proof that america is dumbed down .
3544 at this point not really .
3545 what is morality ?
3546 but benghazi , pay for play , rigged election ... bill clinton is a rapist !
3547 thought this was from the onion
3548 well it 's reassuring to know that bernie is making quid pro quo deals , insulting catholics , holds public and private positions on issues , wants open borders , a hemispheric common market , and ranks his staff on their `` diversity level . ''
3549 good strategy .
3550 that 's not really a plausible defense , old boy
3551 hillary clinton had 30 years to make it impossible for him to commit insurance fraud .
3552 this is sure to bring her down !
3553 obama should be given another nobel prize just for how much he makes republicans fume .
3554 especially shitty in 1969 when we decided to leave the planet behind .
3555 `` proof donald is winning '' polls schmolls .... rallies are where its at .
3556 and wikileaks is covering it up !
3557 i could be victim to some confirmation bias , but i 'm really starting to wonder if there is some internal polling that is devastating , or maybe some of the early voting returns are insurmountable ?
3558 so is there any proof of this or just typical cnn bullshitting ?
3559 trump has abnormal big mouth movements ... what 's your point ?
3560 trump is , as always , focused on what matters .
3561 yeah , i remember when bernie called people of color `` super-predators '' , condemned gay marriage , and intimidated his spouse 's sexual assault victims .
3562 who knew that not being scum would get you popular ?
3563 offfff course he does .
3564 it 's florida ... no surprise .
3565 um is this the 1940s lmfao
3566 i ca n't wait to see what comments get downvoted here .
3567 it does n't matter who violated your rights or did something illegal as long as the evidence can be twisted to show what i want
3568 nice effort , no
3569 this just makes him a smart business man , it 's hillary 's policies that made it possible !
3570 this looks like a reputable source .
3571 more proof that jews run the world .
3572 bombshell , the night before her birthday , who does that ?
3573 we are so fortunate to have trump fighting through those painful bone spurs ( which forced him to defer military service ) lecture the former dean of the army war college about military strategy .
3574 the ranting of florida man .
3575 american democracy at work lol
3576 whoops , looks like the florida polls are rigged again
3577 i thought we did n't want russians meddling in our elections ?
3578 who the fuck cares ?
3579 is this a trump only bashing site ?
3580 that 's not a biased headline at all
3581 wow that really hurt my feelings
3582 [ and holden on tuesday told politico that the document shredding was unrelated to concerns about possible investigations from a democratic senate , ] um , yeah .
3583 honest question - is there a statistic out there for those who get commuted sentences from presidents who end up back in prison for re-offending ?
3584 but i thought the election was rigged !
3585 lol no
3586 such a grand ol party .
3587 oh no !
3588 considering she wants to play chicken with russia over a no fly zone in syria .. trump is correct .. this time .
3589 clearly making this up for the fame .
3590 i want to get off 2016 's wild ride
3591 looks like this new ground breaking evidence should help the fbi in their investigation .
3592 this time its gon na happen !
3593 well , if msnbc said it happened then it must be true .
3594 shitposting to the max .
3595 another example of trump supporters being oppressed .
3596 theeconomiccollapseblog sounds like a very un-biased and relaible site
3597 that 's not a tradition thing , that 's an ethics thing
3598 yeah man - now if only jimmy fallon could raise good points while still being wacky and likable !
3599 it says it is right in the headline .
3600 this is the october surprise we 've all been waiting for
3601 why are n't the embassies using red plastic cups , kegs of budweiser and serving hotdogs for every function , think of the money they would save !
3602 if ailes had his way , i feel like she 'd probably have been showered in something else .
3603 yeah , and the people that fail the test can still count for 3/5 of a vote !
3604 crt hitting this sub hard .
3605 more and more are waking up to the fact that there is no god .
3606 nuclear winter .
3607 because he spent $ 100,000 on the fountain the craftsman who built the fountain was able to open a small business and employ 12 people .
3608 glad there 's both representations of aruements in this subreddit : ) ) )
3609 it 's amazing a completely non-partisan group like wikileaks still has n't been able to find these .
3610 this must be why she 's been charged with and convicted of so many crimes .
3611 but the polls are tightening !
3612 it 's about damn time that the single most important detail contained in any correspondence exchanged in the course of this campaign , privately or publicly , made it into a fucking headline about this .
3613 i thought it was about who is or is not a russian puppet .
3614 if congress passed laws that required drug prices in the us to be similar to canada , then pharma would find a way to jack up canadian prices .
3615 by all means , arrest them both then .
3616 what 're you talking about , he hires 51 women at a time at least once a year .
3617 lock her up !
3618 guys stop persecuting her , this is like the salem witch trials all over again
3619 if they managed to infiltrate the fbi , they probably managed to infiltrate cnn
3620 damn , i guess it was n't an alt-right conspiracy after all .
3621 that makes him smart
3622 this headline could have read : no longer relevant author points out news stories that have been in circulation for weeks .
3623 should n't have wrecked that airplane !
3624 we 're saved !
3625 who the hell give you the right to judge republicans by their actions ?
3626 i guess no one saw hat one coming .
3627 i 'm not american , but ca n't help liking huckabee .
3628 good find , have an orangered or two
3629 well to be fair , they could just be praying that he dies of swine flu .
3630 jon stewart , do your thing .
3631 well at least the rich of america will donate lots of money to support our fellow americans thanks to the tax cuts .
3632 fuck no he was banging my wife the scum deserved to die .
3633 do n't forget about the * * wars * * going on in your name !
3634 /thread
3635 wow ... um ... deep .
3636 they left out the part where he used the donations from a muslim church
3637 a single payer healthcare provider should not decide in death panels who gets treatment - when a quick look at your bank account gives the answer how much better you managed your own life so far to pay all hospital bills easily by yourself
3638 the communists have won !
3639 yes , 1000s of pages of rules , regulations and exceptions never slowed anything down or cost a penny .
3640 yeah but we is freer than those socialests .
3641 you forgot that obama never does anything .
3642 why the down vote ?
3643 in other news , the sky is blue , and dogs chase their tails .
3644 how long until he gets a presidential pardon ?
3645 just more proof that being too full of shit is fatal .
3646 the gop wants us to be just like mexico .
3647 unless they are walking out and back into the kitchen i do n't see how this helps our country .
3648 honestly , i have no problem with them writing off losses , but pay the fair amount on the profits too .
3649 this just in : utah set to force children to sit in silence during music class , bans teaching of instruments .
3650 yea i 'm sure this is really going to hit the female pro-life demographic where it hurts .
3651 why not just let the states vote on whether inter-racial marriage is legal or not ?
3652 having gotten rid of this jack-wagon , i 'm sure that gs stock will go up today .
3653 omg what a surprise !
3654 sounds legit .
3655 yay neighbors !
3656 did rick santorum rape a catholic schoolboy in 1990 ?
3657 well this will certainly help his campaign .
3658 because the nuclear threat is n't working , damnit !
3659 a lot cheaper than hiring a lawyer , i guess .
3660 florida : open season every season
3661 and this is not racism how ?
3662 how out of touch are they with society that they think this is ok ?
3663 exactly , god punishes the wicked with illness , so fuck em !
3664 i ca n't wait till a republican takes office and we 're back to paying .98 cents a gallon
3665 that 's a good way to help them get jobs so they can pay their loans back .
3666 turd nugget
3667 but how can this be with 90 % supporting background checks ?
3668 i dont think that people working full time live in poverty in luxembourg
3669 what was a homicide in 1993 is n't necessarily a homicide today
3670 just my observation with respect to isreal , nothing more .
3671 this ai n't new .
3672 booker better get to packing .
3673 fox was right , i am shocked
3674 no .
3675 wow what a great headline , it named 3 people i do n't relate to on any level .
3676 he should be impeached .
3677 shucks , why is n't he calling for impeachment of the president ?
3678 and that 6 % are probably all drug war lobbyist and republicans .
3679 what a disaster : this can only mean food stamp program is working !
3680 if the moonies are freaked out , then who are we not to be freaked out at least as badly ?
3681 obviously the judge is in direct contact with the obama administration
3682 these kids are the 47 % , which means that they only desire to mooch off society .
3683 this is more an indictment of the black community , than anything else .
3684 this ca n't be true because our leftist overlords say that gun sales are in sharp decline as 90 % of everybody is in favor of anti gun bills .
3685 i find people pushing for smaller government when quenstioned about specifics often want the same amount of government for themselves just smaller government for other people
3686 i meant they should be charged with voluntary manslaughter you twat .
3687 because profits being at an all time-high is a myth .
3688 those are obviously faked , everyone knows obama is from kenyan muslim land .
3689 no worries , they wo n't go after wealthy women .
3690 the conservative 's response to those pointing out what is really needed , `` we cai n't afford it , honey . ''
3691 $ 4.45 a day for one person is n't all that bad if you avoid the shitty foods
3692 oh dear , i was home alone when someone broke in and accidentally raped me !
3693 florida is a state that values their retarded principles over common sense .
3694 ya , but half of that 1.5 million to be denied are illegal immigrant workers , the other half , a mix of the lowest levels of poverty everywhere , the people who are denied acknowledgement and worth .
3695 but then the upper management can not afford to go on that 10th trip to tahiti , fuck you socialism for ruining everything for the very few .
3696 it 's just like jesus said , `` blessed are the rich for they shall inherit everything ! ! ! ! ! ''
3697 good for vermont .
3698 click on the logo for food & amp ; water watch for updates to this basic information .
3699 if the earth were a little warmer i think that would be a good thing because then we could have dinosaurs and tennis-racket sized mosquitos again .
3700 is that the excuse mary jesus ' mother pulled ?
3701 we will not punish the job creators .
3702 did n't she beach her ship once ?
3703 as good as the gop gets .
3704 he 's out of control !
3705 who could have seen this coming ?
3706 yeah lets underpay people even more
3707 wow who would have thought that when people have more money to spend that companies do better ?
3708 is it really a fundamental right ?
3709 experts the most dangerous threats to government and corporations , says the internet
3710 thank you slick rick .
3711 normally this behavior would be called insane , but keep in mind these people * voluntarily * live in tornado alley .
3712 i blaze it every day to stick it to obama
3713 this is what the tea party plans for everyone .
3714 should 've stuck it to the bottom of a ups truck .
3715 nailin palin .
3716 `` what he needs to do is just knowingly use false evidence to convince the people to do what he wants '' cheney continued .
3717 small government !
3718 i guess you just ca n't fix stupid .
3719 they are afraid the high fiber will give you diarrhea .
3720 so .... democrats are now more beholden to corporate interests than the gop ?
3721 mission accomplished .
3722 give me over $ 1 trillion a year to spend , and i too can make the economy look good !
3723 companies = evil taking away their ability to be people = taking away their power therefore this is great , without even knowing what the amendment stands for , because the other two suppositions are obviously true .
3724 * for freedom *
3725 i have but one up vote - the `` oops '' by moore would leave everyone really confused - i assume that was a feature , not a bug !
3726 it 's meant to trickle down to them
3727 damned socialist .
3728 that 's because when gay people have babies they will be gay like their parents .
3729 and if those protesters were prevented from protesting the fox headline would be , `` tyrant obama violating freedom of speech of protesters ! ! ! ''
3730 they 'll just buy more .
3731 are these heartless a-holes evil 24x7 , or only when grasping for the support of the worst our society has to offer ?
3732 so he is part of the `` scam '' too i see
3733 good to know the party that shows the biggest support for the plutocratic elites is being consistent .
3734 well this will certainly rustle some jimmies .
3735 what if i told you that the bible sanctions divorce in several cases ?
3736 ' i 'm not the type of person that i 'd give a marriage license to ' kim davis .
3737 she 's defending the * sanctity * of marriage .
3738 because she is the head of the democratic party of course !
3739 yes .
3740 82 % of criminals view the police unfavorably .
3741 it 's god 's judgement for not cutting education funding quick enough .
3742 i ca n't take this stuff anymore .
3743 today i learned that calgary canada was `` overseas ''
3744 remember this guy will be the next president .
3745 much of the fresh water that spills into the oceans is caused by left wing scientists who push the hoax theory of gravity into the political theater .
3746 yeah obama really needs a lot of votes for his next presidential run .
3747 i really dont like these unilateral power moves the supreme court can legalize gay marriage on their own ( no contact with legislative ) , and the executive can just make laws without consulting any other branch either the government may be bloated and stodgy , but it needs fixing , versus simply hail-marrying everything
3748 you know they 'll be looking for , or be ready to manufacture , anything to distract the populace with .
3749 both parties are the same
3750 diplomacy is the art of getting what you want and shooting anyone who disagrees in the face .
3751 i knew this was all a big misunderstanding !
3752 taking on the real issues
3753 damn foreigners influencing our elections !
3754 repost .
3755 aside from all this speech theories , does n't anyone find it disrespectful how this played out ?
3756 ah , yes , the gop is the evil empire .
3757 nah , just a conservative boondoggle , another solution for a non existent problem to line their pals pockets .
3758 sounds like obama is an evil bigot who needs to check his privilege .
3759 reinvade iraq out of principle
3760 republicans seem to be obsessed with the 47 % .
3761 i 'm looking forward to the flood of self-analysis and reflection among right wing talking heads as they try to understand how they could have been so wrong on something so big .
3762 anybody else disappointed ?
3763 i wonder why they 're the first !
3764 well this explains why the high school there is on edge about being the target of muslim terrorism .
3765 i am looking at the cartoon show , and let me tell you - trump seems the reasonable one .
3766 that man can really pull of a beard .
3767 it was 9/11/1996 , right ?
3768 apparently you do n't know anything about bernie .
3769 carly 's doing a fine job with planned parenthood .
3770 inb4 conservatives complain about people liking a soshulust that they ca n't call a muslim terrorist
3771 trump making americans grate again .
3772 well , by that logic , watergate was no reason to prosecute nixon .
3773 he continued explaining how the old black man who shines kasich 's shoes in the morning is very polite and surprisingly well-spoken .
3774 well , whenever i want guidance on matters that are of a political , or governmental nature , i mostly listen to celebrities , because they always have the best judgement in all things .
3775 we do n't need no stinkin ' separation of powers .
3776 i 'm beginning to connect the dots as to who the real father of the baby might be , given the stupidity of the comments .
3777 the cause and cure for a problem are generally not the same thing .
3778 ... but aborting a fully functional fetus is still legal , right ?
3779 we have a perfectly good narrative going on here , why would we want to sully it with facts ?
3780 yeah putting that poem on the statue of liberty seems sort of short sighted now .
3781 `` suspend ''
3782 she is essentially a republican
3783 making a long corrupt texas agency even more corrupt is something of an achievement in this state .
3784 is there anything he would n't fuck up ?
3785 good thing the republicans are for following the law of the land , which is the constitution and which specifically states about freedom of religion .
3786 that 'll fix obama 's out of control spending spree !
3787 yeah , and men ca n't be feminists .
3788 it 's more that they do n't have lobbyists .
3789 whatever , my vote does n't count anyway
3790 the solution here is simple : code is evil and programming should be outlawed in the united states .
3791 oh thank god ... that shit was keeping me up at nights .
3792 that is why the death penalty should be privatized .
3793 hahahahahahahahaha
3794 ooo i hope he 's doing it to run for president !
3795 shocking .......... .. .. .. .. ..
3796 the tea party would call him a cino ( catholic in name only )
3797 the mad surgeon .
3798 sickening , but are there any republicans other than john mccain who have spoken out against torture ?
3799 except real income has increased
3800 blame republicans except people from both party are critical of it , including candidate obama .
3801 good thing everybody agrees what kind of country us must become .
3802 it 's totally ok , though , because 1 trillion will flow to the 99 % and 11 trillion will flow to the 1 % so they can create jobs !
3803 op 's account is 2 days old .
3804 so i guess now we can say that china is trying to influence our election now ?
3805 can we get a list of people china has criticized ?
3806 because they are n't successful in technology at all .
3807 and i am sure the republicans who wasted millions of dollars having a thousand investigations over benghazi will be sure to question comey on his partisan efforts
3808 coastlines have been changing for billions of years , the issues pointed out in this article would continue even if use of fossil fuels were to be completely eliminated .
3809 oh wow , this is surprising on so many levels .
3810 good old unbiased journalism .
3811 no conflict of interest here .
3812 they do n't really care about rigging elections otherwise they would go after hillary and the dnc primaries scandal .
3813 whelp tumblr is now voting for hillary x huma
3814 oh man theres so much open mindedness and well though out discussion on both sides of the issue and certianly no circle jerking at all here .
3815 man , that sounds terrifying !
3816 why would you respect someone who supported a sexual assualter ?
3817 oh wow this guy will literally try anything .
3818 `` they say good things about me , i 'll say good things about them '' - trump , probably
3819 this 'll really help secure the undecided no racist vote for trump
3820 `` real men '' make death threats
3821 the party of personal responsibility strikes again .
3822 trickledown economics , climate change denialism , religious kooks on the supreme court .... boy , we sure can afford a trump presidency !
3823 i do n't see the big deal ; lots of people who were born before this election cycle are voting .
3824 yup , do n't worry about that pesky constitution , it only gets in the way of forcing your viewpoints upon the masses
3825 not voting until i hear who the old farmer 's almanac endorses
3826 donald trump is a business failure , and a human failure , whose single greatest , and perhaps only , talent is making others pay for his mistakes .
3827 right because trump literally committed these actions
3828 why alter the headline ?
3829 is this like the new `` thanks obama '' or are we really going to pretend this type of thing never happened before trump ran for potus ?
3830 imagine all thhe people who wo n't read the article to realize the shooter was white .
3831 perfect logic here .
3832 money is bad in politics , unless it 's my team .
3833 my country is back in the news ... wonderful ... what great coverage ...
3834 `` ertel would not divulge who received votes in the fraudulent seminole ballots '' ...... why not ?
3835 maybe he just really really likes lynyrd skynyrd .
3836 only makes sense that the god emperor of 4chan would be into lolis .
3837 true presidential temperament
3838 the compassionate right everyone .
3839 guys .... the title is
3840 totally not true until published by huffpost or vox .
3841 it was a false flag , the poll worker cut her own hand !
3842 i was hungry , so i voted for risotto !
3843 do you think we 'd be all up in that mess if they did n't have oil ?
3844 he should tell the story of when his dad shot jfk .
3845 thanks again russian hackers
3846 this article violates the established policy of pretending that george w. bush never happened .
3847 better to be unqualified than * * disqualified * *
3848 his respect for women is the best
3849 but , nobody loves mexico and it 's people more than trump
3850 if the fbi is going to pull out their torches and pitchforks every time a neo-con shits out a new york times bestseller , we 're in for a long four years .
3851 the only thing that i agree with on this ( god ) forsaken site .
3852 history shows that there is nothing dangerous about security forces falling in line behind an authoritarian leader .
3853 yeah because california is known for its common sense gun laws
3854 what a classy bunch
3855 trump supporter : voter fraud confirmed
3856 this just shows how good he is at business
3857 yes , but they did n't sufficiently hurt the poor .
3858 financially brave with other people 's money .
3859 you know , in other countries , the `` conservative '' side is really different .
3860 do n't worry trumpsters , he 's got great leverage .
3861 it 's called being fiscaly responsible ..... its not a loss
3862 a hoax they are themselves falling for the most .
3863 but susan sarandon said they 're the same and she wears the professor glasses and is a smart woman who `` does n't vote with her vagina ''
3864 rigged
3865 perhaps this is what our news will look like if trump is elected gets his judges to gut the first amendment ?
3866 you 're joking , but that is close to what they are saying about john podesta right now .
3867 ... but muh narrative .
3868 smh obama 'll do anything to get us in his fema camps
3869 it does n't feel true .
3870 `` globalists '' = `` the jews '' you can figure out the rest of the dog whistles , they 're not very subtle .
3871 because of death threats
3872 is n't this old news , or have i misunderstood something ?
3873 will donald trump condemn the liberal animals for vandalizing a grave site ?
3874 trump supporters keep finding out the hard way that election fraud is not as easy or safe as trump claims .
3875 i 'm sure he 's going to be 100 % honest once he gets into office though .
3876 im sure the poor guy was suffering from a mental illness .
3877 i feel like you guys are probably overlooking how much she earned as an escort .
3878 1st amendment is overrated anyway .
3879 deport her !
3880 good thing he runs such a tight ship .
3881 surely this will derail his campaign .
3882 literally was going to post `` 4 more years ! ''
3883 so , having sex with horses is supposed to help ?
3884 the laziest of replies .
3885 given the manner in which trump announced his presidential bid , latinos would have to be insane not to vote against him in massive numbers .
3886 bizarrely enough , they seem to prefer someone who 's been in the situation room monitoring covert ops .
3887 they lost their shit over that cop killer then fell silent after finding out he was a white trump supporter .
3888 if she had a problem with it and felt intimidated she should have brought her gun , so should have her son .
3889 heaven forbid we follow all the rules , even the ones we do n't like .
3890 fucking plebs with jobs wanting to vote .
3891 just like we waited for the facts about the trump rape case .
3892 clearly an assassination attempt by pro-trump police officers .
3893 how 're his modeling skills ?
3894 while i do n't condone violence you do n't have full 1st amendment rights to do whatever at a private event you are trying to crash .
3895 only if you live in michigan , minnesota , pennsylvania , or wisconsin .
3896 a political ad with misleading information but not technically lying wow ... never saw that before
3897 and to think i just saw on the_donald a tweet of a graph that showed trump winning the hispanic vote .
3898 and she killed vince foster , in the library , with the candlestick , too .
3899 his has such a good temperament
3900 water is wet
3901 suck it , giuliani !
3902 disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of washington voters is cool .
3903 weakness in the ~~aryan gene pool~~ american citizenry must not be allowed to propagate , amirite ?
3904 is there anything he accuses hillary of that he is not guilty of ?
3905 yawn .
3906 yeah college professors had the ability to figure out if you plagiarized half of a sentence in a 20 page term paper from pretty much any website or book in existence in seconds at least a decade ago , no shit the fbi can scan through 650,000 text emails in a week .
3907 to be fair , joe is an asshole who needs to shut up .
3908 wow so convincing !
3909 as tragic as the mccann case is , it 's nowhere near satanic enough for podesta to be involved .
3910 he 's to busy to listen to the lyrics though
3911 what was the first european language spoken in spain ?
3912 minimum job requirement : cheating on three wives .
3913 hispanics are getting duped by the dishonest media , but uneducated whites are seeing through the lies .
3914 of course glenn does , where else is he going to score all that ~~cocaine~~ outrage fuel ?
3915 i am surprise the beyhive is n't in arms yet .
3916 ah man i rooted for lenin in the apprentice .
3917 she 's right , if truth kills then it 's a good thing assassination attempt .
3918 and democrats are ever so concerned about respecting traditions .
3919 houston , we have a ballot .
3920 well , he 's their kinda guy : mean spirited , petty , and bullying .
3921 ironic coming from the woman who destroys evidence under subpeona and smashes her phones .
3922 groping the crystal ball
3923 btfo
3924 he 's definitely going to lose now
3925 let me guess ... she 's voting for trump is n't she ?
3926 awww does that make everyone feel better now ?
3927 de nada .
3928 she should , she created them .
3929 but russian funding of trump is just fine , right ?
3930 clinton pushed him in assuming .
3931 they do n't want the immigration problem
3932 nice
3933 even if they pass the grandparent rule ?
3934 i guess we were wrong about what he meant when he told his supporters to go to `` certain places '' and watch for cost fraud .
3935 sarah palin , always a hallmark of sanity ...
3936 i dont trust the rhetoric from the unproven serial liar trump
3937 the polls do n't close for hours , genius .
3938 one of the pleasures of this historic day is knowing that giuliani will not be taken seriously by either party after today .
3939 wrong .
3940 that 's because a clinton victory is riggedly probable
3941 why does anyone even listen to rush anyway ?
3942 he thinks his personal politics are more important than his job .
3943 remember ... it 's the corrupt establishment that folks are punishing .
3944 uh , yeah ?
3945 for fucks sake america , if you couldnt do the one job you had properly , you should have outsourced it like you always do .
3946 those countries look great
3947 well close enough
3948 i have a feeling a lot of democrats are going to take them up on this offer
3949 see , that 's why women should n't be in politics
3950 it 's because college educated white women are sexist bernie bros .
3951 if it existed i would support it .
3952 there 's a bright spot
3953 being crybullies have pushed around alot of politicians , but this one was elected because of that mentality ... time to suck it up and move forward .
3954 i wonder how many times she had to have a nap in the middle .
3955 the dnc is going to start listening to him now , right ?
3956 yeah , let 's increase taxes .
3957 so great that he led to potus trump .
3958 i 'm sure it will all sort itself out once the insurers can cross state lines .
3959 romney was running against the first black president this is n't very surprising
3960 this is probably the best shit i 've heard all year
3961 so tolerant
3962 i feel that some mansplaining is necessary here to say that it was never ever up to them .
3963 what difference does it make ?
3964 what wold carson know about sensing victory ?
3965 daily reminder that this is an anti-trump story , and there are no pro-trump comments , thus proving that we 're all shills .
3966 * slow clap * so proud .
3967 ryan and mcconnell say nyet !
3968 this will certainly stop trump from becoming president
3969 comments here so far are funny ... trillions wasted on war `` omg we could have rebuilt our infrastructure '' trillions spent on infrastructure `` omg just wasting money ... i wish my internet was faster ''
3970 i 'll be honest .... i never knew in my 18 years of living that private prisons were a thing
3971 i really hope that committee trump forms to investigate pay to play , goes after this
3972 good
3973 that 's some quality political discussion ya got going there
3974 this is like if hillary had saudi contacts ... oh wait
3975 maybe we should waterboarding him so he can form an experienced opinion
3976 sure , better than ( god forbid ) a black guy or woman .
3977 more brilliant ideas from the trump campaign .
3978 wow the best cabinet possible
3979 good they deserve it .
3980 he 'll restrict research funding to religious organizations .
3981 never would have expected hypocrisy from trump .
3982 anybody willing to buy that in the first place did n't need to be strung along any further .
3983 but guys , he was n't serious about it , he actually likes the gays , he was just pandering to win the election .
3984 shocking
3985 i always wanted another recession .
3986 german engineering mate : )
3987 if he runs and loses , will people finally stop saying he can win ?
3988 the empathy of one as well .
3989 uh i 'm pretty sure it 's an embarrassment for the white working class being as they 're all kkk supporters .
3990 if an elderly man is our only hope we 're fucked .
3991 and if trump had gotten more votes and lost i 'm sure everyone here would be saying trump really won .
3992 bullshit article written in the same condescending voice that lost the democrats the election .
3993 hasta la vista isis
3994 america is going back to the 80s .
3995 this is trump playing 4d chess , he will have things he wants to pass that he knows other republicans oppose , so he will just say `` hey i 'll repeal obamacare ... if you pass this too ''
3996 the owner of this site is trump 's son in law
3997 and this is n't even close to a major problem compared to the fact a reality tv huckster is now going to rule the world and decide if there 's nuclear war .
3998 'people will die ' with obamacare .
3999 i 'd recommend giving this post an abortion .
4000 so glad hillary used her convention to showcase new talent like obama had the opportunity in 2004 .
4001 it was her turn !
4002 yep , nothing but risotto recipes .
4003 you know , i had n't heard one surrogate after the election mention russia , it 's like that whole argument just stopped ... i wonder why ?
4004 why would russia help trump after buying all the uranium mining rights from hillary ?
4005 please try to get video of as many of the protesters as possible , especially if they are inciting and committing violence .
4006 yeah , that totally would have worked .
4007 perhaps all these brave progressives should grow a backbone .
4008 so presidential
4009 i 'm sure if we just give putin the sudetenland he will be happy .
4010 but the will of the people voted for trump
4011 it was all a con , what a shocker
4012 it 's salty in here
4013 yeah , fuck those white people , amirite ?
4014 at a certain point , we have to accept that we are no longer the # 1 super power of the world .
4015 what a true hero she is
4016 now that 's what i call a mandate !
4017 /r politics aka /r redscare .
4018 this looks credible
4019 hate crimes indeed , like that man in chicago being pulled from his car by hooligans and viciously beaten on camera .
4020 yeah , because i believe anything the media says .
4021 one thing the democrats absolutely have to be careful of when cleaning up shop is to make sure they do not get co-op 'd by rabid sjw fundamentalists .
4022 that link/article was worthless
4023 is that what those fema camps are for ?
4024 sears ' stock just went up
4025 they need to fix this shit by making id free , this will make everyone happy and the republicans can go fuck themselves .
4026 this is what corruption looks like .
4027 wow , i did n't know there were tens of thousands of media members in the area who could collaborate on faking a protest .
4028 that 'll chance his policy for sure !
4029 the school was just embarrassed he was treating class like an episode of the young turks or cnn
4030 which swamp was trump supposed to drain , again ?
4031 well that does n't sound threatening in any way shape or form .
4032 so are you going to help support the unwanted children from poor mothers who ca n't get to an abortion clinic you bastard ?
4033 [ * looks back too all those times the same was said about obama * ] yeah you are totally right !
4034 what is a trump anyway ?
4035 shocker
4036 do you also love policy prescriptions and rhetoric that function to threaten civil rights ?
4037 let the new justice department handle that instead .
4038 do as i say and not as i do .
4039 may obama is n't moving out ?
4040 easy , bing-watch 'west wing ' to get a crash course on how to run the white house
4041 nah fuck that i did n't get to see dinosaurs why should my kids get to see polar bears and penguins .
4042 wow , what a kind and generous man
4043 holy shit , move on people .
4044 but all those phantasmal manufacturing jobs and winning !
4045 job security is a great thing going into a recession .
4046 false flag conducted by lizard people .
4047 that was proven false you fucks
4048 safety pins , thanks richard hell , maybe the punk style will come back .
4049 obviously nepotism is a good thing # maga
4050 how many ivy league degrees do these guys have ?
4051 i do n't see what the problem is ... the head of the dnc was only taking money from predatory payday loan companies .
4052 looks like electing donald trump has unforeseen benefits
4053 suck it ryan
4054 pretty sure the white women who voted for trump are just fine with the results
4055 will you ever build that second shed ?
4056 because there 's only one culture ?
4057 its sad to see how much the trump haters are reaching , you have become the thing you hate .
4058 surely that 's what the founding fathers would have intended .
4059 why was n't bernie this upset when hrc and the dnc undermined his campaign ?
4060 i 'm sure he will keep his cool and be diplomatic when meting foreign leaders
4061 talk like that is why trump won .
4062 god help us all .
4063 do you think donald actually is an autocrat or is he just such a self centered douche bag that he only * acts * like it
4064 if that 's the most he does i 'll be very happy .
4065 well ... they are outsiders ... right ?
4066 paid rioters
4067 well if they demanded it ... okay !
4068 the chinese have infiltrated the highest levels of the us military !
4069 once you go barack , you never go back .
4070 trump has always been more corrupt than clinton , i 'll be so happy when he screws over the people who voted for him .
4071 a president not doing what they said while running .. shocking
4072 shocking ...
4073 some signed the petition early and often !
4074 uh , he already knows more than the generals , so there 's really nothing to learn .
4075 well muslims dont deserve rights
4076 ahh the usual `` blame the 3rd party '' rhetoric when your candidate sucks so bad they ca n't even win by 10 % .
4077 yeah , that 'll show him .
4078 i 'm down .
4079 wow wtf , that 's literally the first step nazis took with jews .
4080 they should round those protesters up and put them in some kind of camp .
4081 what a down to earth guy we can all relate to
4082 we just lost the moral high ground to china , i will never forgive the people who voted for trump for this .
4083 but trump made him do it !
4084 inb4 liberal victim blaming .
4085 yes let 's start hiring based on race , f * * * skills ..... which explains why white nationalists supported trump .
4086 the splc is the same organization that spent the election fighting cartoon frogs , they have no legitimacy .
4087 because time assumes that rational , thinking people vote democrat and you have to be out of your mind to vote for the republican candidate .
4088 lmao and she 's doing such a wonderful job
4089 but look at all the protests in countries with socialized medicine marching in the streets to switch to a system like ours .
4090 did n't see that coming
4091 if there 's one opinion i trust about the inner workings of left wing politics it 's the true bolsheviks like heat st
4092 thanks obama
4093 but he is a racist ... therefore if you are against wall street corruption then you hate black people
4094 see it turns out things can be privately funded and the government does n't have to have its ' fingers in everything !
4095 human , male , american , fathers , presidents ... there 's some room for more difference .
4096 should n't be a problem - they 've got such a deep bench
4097 but it 's all just `` economic anxiety , '' right ?
4098 party of small government
4099 the embargo has n't worked for 50 years ... let 's try 50 more !
4100 just because us democrats did this does n't mean he can do the same .
4101 but trump was a champion of the working class ?
4102 not to mention , china created global warming
4103 they know first hand haha
4104 he should fire all the republicans cause the dems want so
4105 relax we 're only a week in .
4106 to be fair , they need to stop hurting his fragile little feelings .
4107 maybe hillary should have cared about single-payer health care .
4108 well herr bannon certainly has that little air about him .
4109 those american born robots are really going to help the american working class find jobs .
4110 how is this reductive shit the top comment ?
4111 that sounds fair .
4112 i wonder how different that is than the amount that felt less proud before the election
4113 off to a great start !
4114 remember you 're not allowed to call them that or the true americans will get upset and vote against you out of spite
4115 pretty sure the internment camps were why we won wwii ... right ?
4116 `` leading state sponsor terrorism '' is that gulf state dick so far up the daily callers ass they ca n't see past the red sea ?
4117 thank you people who voted for him and people who stayed at home .
4118 if only there was a designer in the trump family who could pick up the slack .
4119 it 's a good thing we saved ourselves from the secret republican , hillary clinton !
4120 so ... he 's saying no pardon for hillary then ?
4121 i am so sorry pat robertson failed to get this plum job .
4122 finally , as a white guy who did n't even vote for trump i am happy its not solely my fault anymore .
4123 just like how obama was going to take everyone 's guns ?
4124 next up , trump uni-'merica .
4125 i 'm shocked .
4126 plus who need 400k salary if he can cut the taxes for his companies ?
4127 yeah fuck the next generation !
4128 oh this was probably just another liberal false flag .
4129 there is a black guy in there
4130 that 's because he wo n't be living there .
4131 well duh .
4132 yup , asking that the vp uphold the rights of -all- americans is so cringeworthy .
4133 but they 're all without sin so it 's cool .
4134 are trump hotels as gaudy as his home ?
4135 the one about the muslims is not at all like hitlars propaganda of the jews .
4136 wait , i thought trump and hillary were the same ?
4137 same place he is now : only in john mccain 's fevered imagination .
4138 because the hamilton `` scandal '' is a more catchy headline
4139 i would give anything for a john mccain presidency at the moment .
4140 riiight ... not at all like trump himself .
4141 just until we figure out what 's going on !
4142 freedom of religion just means that you can belong to any denomination of christianity you want .
4143 that 's ridiculous but true
4144 this changes * everything *
4145 this justified the vote for all of those hardcore conservatives out there .
4146 then stop having business meetings .
4147 that thought is very troubling .
4148 oh good , i was worried president trump might be lacking in tax write offs .
4149 apparently , no issue with getting drunk off your ass and smoking as much tobacco as you can get your hands on .
4150 no
4151 when will the interests of white men ever be adequately addressed by mainstream politics ?
4152 if we onshoreed more manufacturing i bet we could have an impact on the environment that 's a benefit tbh
4153 are we taking salon seriously now ?
4154 at this point anyone is better than donna brazile and debbie wasserman schultz .
4155 so what you 're saying is there 's a painkiller epidemic in trump states and those folks are all about to lose whatever insurance they could possibly have hoped for ?
4156 it 's nice to see the enlightened commentors here offering constructive solutions to this problem and not simply contributing to it .
4157 either this did n't happen , as the aid of the argentinian president explicitly said since they were in the room , or the president is spineless .
4158 * these fucking amateurs , dude *
4159 i 'm sure the cbs polls are real this time
4160 maybe he should not have been an ass- hole then .
4161 i 'm sure all those 60 something conservatives think this will be just great .
4162 locker room talk
4163 i heard he is also a first rate toilet cleaner , so having him as an ambassador would be huge as far as the hygiene of the british embassy .
4164 i 'd rather have a president fighting against the mainstream media than one colluding with it
4165 oh msm you liar you , the real poll is right there on briebart showing 95 % support .
4166 trey gowdy will still call for hearings , just to make sure
4167 it 's actually only going to be 1 trillion now that they wo n't have to build that moon prison to contain hillary since reconsidering prosecuting her .
4168 good
4169 be patient , the sell-off will come .
4170 you know that 's funny because i 'm a card carrying republican , as evidenced by my beliefs in increasing minority access to voting , the realization that trickle down economics will never , ever work , and of course , my dedication to supporting life once it emerges from the womb .
4171 congratulations , you played yourself .
4172 i guess we know that trump met with paul ryan today .
4173 funny how all the complaints about the current system are coming post election .
4174 at least the trains will run on time .
4175 good thing the popular vote is how we elect the president
4176 i feel america getting greater already , are n't you excited everyone ?
4177 soros belongs in prison
4178 let 's keep committing crimes to make sure oil keeps getting spilled out of rail cars and trucks !
4179 we have developed a physical resistance to irony , think its something in the water
4180 that is more true then most people believe .
4181 hey look , someone called hannity and he wants a safe space
4182 someone tell me how to feel
4183 what about trumped , a new national k-12 charter education startup run for profit ... because only the private sector knows how to run things , right ?
4184 did this woman have some sort of cerebral accident ?
4185 i get it , because ben is urban , right ?
4186 such thoughtfulness , they know winter is around the corner and want ny times to be ready for the snow fall .
4187 he knows more than those giving the briefings , so why bother .
4188 i 'm glad breitbart was on top of this .
4189 nra is going to have to find a new way to scare gun nuts now !
4190 you will miss it when your job is sourced to robotics and you suffer from some ailment that you then have to pay $ 60k for that you do not have .
4191 trump is by far the most lgbtwtfbbq friendly member of the gop of all time .
4192 if only scalia were around still and we had a majority of strict interpreters of the constitution on the supreme court .
4193 this witch hunt is getting crazier each day
4194 texas will simply take this as a signal to make prisons and jails even worse
4195 thank you based jill
4196 the swap is being drained as we speak .
4197 it 's not uncommon to see that in europe either and has been that way for decades .
4198 oh no , please do n't replace my ridiculously expensive healthcare .
4199 god , `` alt-right '' is such a politically correct term
4200 or , that he dog-whistles to white supremacists ...
4201 too soon
4202 if passed i 'm sure this law would have no negative consequences
4203 you mean a neocon corporatist third way shill ... if you did n't steal the primary from bernie by not voting for him , he would 've won the general where i 'm sure there would 've been a bunch more far-left voters .
4204 good god
4205 proof ?
4206 yes , having significantly more them half of voters against the president should be a meaningless fact .
4207 i could be an nfl quarterback if you deduct the fact i throw the ball like a 6 year old girl basically i 'm saying i 'm tim tebow
4208 trump is literally hitler
4209 you wanted him , you got him .
4210 can i buy stock in coffin companies ?
4211 i thought i heard he did n't vote but he * would * have voted for trump ?
4212 gon na sue all those parents at sandy hook elementary to prove it was a false flag operation to get yer guns ?
4213 yeah because they were paragons of virtue .
4214 hey everyone this guy is a looney tune see , no one cares .
4215 how does one even going about becoming an elector ?
4216 what , you do n't like your money supply tied to something someone digs out of the ground ?
4217 what a coward .
4218 as soon as they round all 11 million illegals , start keeping tab on all us muslims and start stoping and frisking all minorities they will reach the highest respect they ever hoped for .
4219 hardly political .
4220 san francisco is a great city and a tolerant place to live , as long as you 're a tech millionaire .
4221 it 's fantastic how much trump broke liberals ' brains that they 're calling him the loser of the election without a trace of irony lol
4222 i do n't care about hillary 's emails and i am also willing to give petraeus a pass because he 's actually reasonably sane unlike most of trump 's other picks .
4223 way to unite the country .
4224 boy that protest vote/nonvote is really paying off for us `` true progressives '' .
4225 i 'm all for burning that bitch .
4226 you see though trump once held a gay pride flag so that means he will be best , biglyest president for the gays .
4227 yeah but they only did it to brown non americans so it 's ok
4228 he 'll just take credit for helping it get back on its feet .
4229 i think the drain is clogged
4230 in canada we do n't use zip code
4231 well hopefully they get cancer and die without healthcare and ca n't vote in the next one .
4232 wew
4233 oh wow , another variation of the old `` i 'm not racist my friend is [ insert minority here ] '' argument .
4234 he is n't taking a the salary given to the president either .
4235 plus a 15 % discount at any trump resort properties !
4236 the ada is just a safe space and all these alleged disabled people should just man up .
4237 so this guy thinks the federal reserve should be stored in trump tower or that ~~hourly employees~~ low wage citizens should be paid in trump bucks ?
4238 based on the meltdowns and hyperbole in this thread by the libs , he sounds like he 's the right guy .
4239 glad to see the white house is wise enough to not blame millions of people , including americans , for the actions of one man who most likely suffered from mental illness .
4240 why not ?
4241 he 's a fake black
4242 fuck rural america
4243 great .
4244 i always wondered who was backing those douchebags .
4245 * economic anxiety intensifies * .
4246 he 's just keeping up with the hitler stereotype , nothing to see here move along .
4247 black and female victimization did n't work out well , got ta try something new
4248 but it makes them feel terrible about themselves so its all good
4249 thanks obama
4250 oh boy , i ca n't wait for democrats to nominate hilary in 2020
4251 nah , she 's been insane for quite some time .
4252 surprise !
4253 but heroin 's really cheap now .
4254 the new axis-of-evil !
4255 it 's clowns like you that make fox news possible .
4256 good luck with that one .
4257 but do n't worry , the individual mandate is definitely unconstitutional
4258 itt : pissing contest
4259 why does reddit love muslims / islam but hate christianity ?
4260 well , i guess that settles it , then .
4261 at least bill o'reilly wore a tie .
4262 how do you expect them to get off their lazy asses and work , if they 're not hungry ?
4263 but we could have cut 523 social services instead of giving up having a really cool airplane with 5 engines !
4264 perhaps they should n't , especially if income from outside sources already makes them rich .
4265 fucking teacher 's union , they can burn in hell
4266 but , but , but , we have to respect their views .
4267 cause all teaparty supporters want to kill the president and hate gays
4268 silly redditor , terrorism is only done by brown people !
4269 embarrassment can only last for so long .
4270 everyone needs to read this article .
4271 the arsenic was added to counter-balance the growth hormones and antibiotics .
4272 to those who think the market can regulate itself : industrial revolution .
4273 i will not vote for obama if he is going to sit there and tell the truth !
4274 breitbart ; dr
4275 most likely because humans come out as infants
4276 first they give us the work , then they throw us in jail
4277 this case will likely be thrown out because of the mandatory arbitration clauses in everyone 's contract which the supreme court so wisely upheld .
4278 the buffett rule is a gimmick , but i 'll give you that it 's at least a start
4279 just more proof showing that the non-invasive israeli method is absolutely superior .
4280 it 's only considered fraud if he is found guilty , which i doubt will happen .
4281 that was 50 years ago , maybe they 've changed their 'minds ' .
4282 i ca n't be the only one who is n't surprised by this shit anymore
4283 is irony supposed to be so sad ?
4284 but hey , cutting taxes should fix this right ?
4285 please use another citation ... headlines by themselves are not credible .
4286 but she does n't look sick , she 's fine , slap her on the ass and tell her to suck it up .
4287 dont worry about it , voterid will fix it .
4288 clearly the wind has to work harder to move the turbines therefore making the world get hotter .
4289 thanks obama !
4290 ya 'll enjoy your hatefest against teachers and schools , the conservatives need to stop all tax funded education , you must help .
4291 how about make those schools prisons and pocket the $ 400,000,000 .
4292 it 's c14 depletion in the atmosphere caused by the eminese burning of c14 depleted fossile fuels
4293 okay , in the impossible event that i ever got a five-minute chat with this president , i would show him this article and ask , `` wtf , man ? ''
4294 because science has a well established liberal bias .
4295 there are no such mistakes , this is planned thieving by people of authority
4296 that makes me feel so much safer !
4297 but , it 's obama 's fault !
4298 if true , this is at least a step in the right direction .
4299 give them more money , they 've been so amazingly effective
4300 how do you think they got profits to soar ?
4301 well it is clearly bush 's fault
4302 so this is what a fair trial looks like
4303 bullshit
4304 lets not get too liberal here folks , they 're here to protect us from terrorists .
4305 oh here is kochreason , all ready to announce the teapublican congress they elected is going to repeal the domestic spying operation .
4306 unfortunately , the obama administration has a secret interpretation of copyright law
4307 well when you lose ted nugent , you lose the nation .
4308 few things are more rewarding than watching conservatives attack conservatives .
4309 because * that * would be an unconstitutionally broad invasion of privacy , unlike having the nsa spy on * everyone * .
4310 these people should be in prison for what they 're doing .
4311 man there sure are a lot of terrorists they are tracking down and catching .
4312 i 'm sure those responsible for this will be held accountable , and punished to the full extent of the law .
4313 impeach obama for the nsa spying scandal and replace him with a republican that also supports the nsa spying on us !
4314 i 'm sure this is what `` rule of law '' was supposed to mean .
4315 there are few people in this world i wish harm on - but in his case i really hope cheney does n't die of natural causes .
4316 `` dem ' gud dum furaners breed like rabbits ''
4317 it 's nice to see that all that hard work done by those really pleasant conservative fellows is finally paying off .
4318 every newspaper in america is owned by the people that are keeping him locked up .
4319 that pesky constitution always getting in the way
4320 i 'm sure he 's shaking in his boots because of the statement of one member of the irosh parliament .
4321 great a commie as the head of the fbi ... just another signal that our country is headed in the wrong direction
4322 a bunch of drunken terrorist bombers called him a war criminal !
4323 i bet the loony john birch society would love this .
4324 palin 2016
4325 i 'm sure criminals will quickly take advantage of this law and start carrying their guns openly .
4326 nsa to senators wyden & amp ; udall : because you do n't have the courage to stop us or to actually tell the public what we 're lying about .
4327 only if `` fix it later '' does n't involve killing someone .
4328 all this means is that the republicans will now blame each other for letting the dems `` get away with benghazi '' .
4329 3 fox `` news '' posts in a row ?
4330 while giving huge tax giveaways to wealthy corporations , i 'll bet .
4331 yeah , but then nothing would trickle down
4332 i 'd sure like to meet one of those 60 % ers and marvel at their disposable income !
4333 color me fucking shocked .
4334 the tea party should start their own political party ; break away from the gop once and for all .
4335 so he 's threatening us ?
4336 and a couple on the south with the highest natural disaster rates as well .
4337 amusing , as you apparently view the washingtonexaminer `` a legit source . ''
4338 only three quarters ?
4339 i am surprised huffington post missed this great story
4340 lol ... what an asshat .
4341 do n't worry the government will surly fix this .
4342 this is so new , nixon used little riots as a regular part of his campaign appearances .
4343 anyone know if the nypd strangler will actually face punishment in the courts ?
4344 just because they behead people does n't make them a bad person .
4345 they forgot to mention death camps .
4346 not a problem for oklahoma as they obviously consider an education to be overrated .
4347 well you know for that third term , it is going to take a huge pile of cash .
4348 which is 30 more middle class americans that the gop would like to see be provided health care .
4349 is n't the republican meme always about how liberals ca n't handle money and budgets ?
4350 these two things must be totally unrelated and in no way have racist intent .
4351 well maybe that 's a good thing , did n't hurt reagan any
4352 grc is getting a lot of positive attention lately .
4353 if only more people had more guns , this would n't happen
4354 gop=dixiecrats
4355 there 's a reddit reality distortion bubble guys , sometimes we need to be mindful of being out of touch with reality .
4356 notice how obama is upset and trump just shrugs .
4357 and republicans tend to look more at the color in one 's wallet
4358 trump running for president : 'horrible ' but these things happen
4359 its jobs - jobs for police jobs for ambulance drivers hospital workers doctors lawyers tv news people lots of kobs in mass shootings lots of jobs in killings its about jobs in america that is the government response
4360 as long as we do n't post the shooter 's names or pictures this will all stop .
4361 because there 's more love in literally every other advanced country .
4362 facts and logic do n't win arguments , guns do !
4363 because jesus was all about superior firepower .
4364 this should be fun .
4365 because the unions we have are so great .
4366 i believe her .
4367 as a rational thinking human being , i trust the national enquirer with all the hard-hitting and accurate news .
4368 huh ... i would have guessed green party
4369 it 's remarkable that an even higher percentage will vote as if it is n't , regardless of what they said in a survey .
4370 this is somehow obama 's fault , i 'm sure .
4371 today in the news unbiased journalism reaches an all time low
4372 funny how people react after generations of systemic ghettoization , dehumanization , and lack of justice .
4373 it 's nice to see completely unbiased articles
4374 serious question what does biden have to do to convince people he 's not running ?
4375 that david brooks is quick on the uptake , is n't he ?
4376 you sir or madam are a bafoon .
4377 climate change is the only threat that is occurring right now on our soil , with the potential for irreversible damage .
4378 yeah , nuclear war is totally not a greater security threat .
4379 because a sunburn is * obviously * the worst thing that could come from climate change !
4380 fuck its sad that this guy will be killed if he comes any closer to becoming president .
4381 i 'm sure democrats are impressed by his frag count .
4382 ~~jim crow~~ war on drugs
4383 except that the democrats are the ones who are talking reality while the republicans are still denying that climate change is happening , supporting economic policies that have caused multiple recessions , trying to give the military more money after they 've already said that they do n't need any more funding , pandering to religious fundamentalists , and wanting to cut services to those that need them most
4384 what has surprised me about his campaign is how disciplined he is - he clearly smart as a whip
4385 liberal lies
4386 expect a hard hitting interview .
4387 now if only we could make lgbt status a protected class ... but that 's special rights , i guess .
4388 i wonder where they would have gotten that impression ?
4389 oh that 's a reliable news site .
4390 she did well .
4391 but she 's planning for strong regulations .
4392 while the democratic poll numbers for candidates seem to move slowly , it looks like the gop base jumps from shiny object to shiny object on a weekly basis .
4393 i 'm sure this headline is 100 % accurate .
4394 let 's just declare war on * * everyone * * !
4395 but think of all the bankruptcy attorneys it would put out of business !
4396 did sanders call for an end to water fluoridation and i missed it or something ?
4397 will be very interesting to see how `` morality '' shifts the more and more religion dies off .
4398 shit , i 'll pay em ' 200
4399 ethics are overrated anyway , the whole point of holding office is to enrich yourself and your ceo freinds .
4400 because both parties are the same right guys ?
4401 but if we set up needle exchanges that 'll just encourage it !
4402 they never mention the anthrax attacks either .
4403 this is pathetic .
4404 pfft , ethics are for liberals
4405 many of the large charter schools in my area that popped up 8-10 years ago with fan-fare and news coverage are gone .
4406 when will politicians start talking/realizing about automation being a factor in the loss of jobs
4407 if there 's one thing that makes college affordable , it 's government regulation
4408 said the same thing in 08 feel the bern
4409 this is just blatantly untrue , but ok
4410 i was just starting to feel the chafe .
4411 but his supporters are so passionate they will work for free .
4412 what a loss
4413 our education system ca n't be great until teachers can work for minimum wage .
4414 no bias in this comment
4415 simply common sense gun legislation that should be approved by anyone with even half a brain .
4416 wow , a state senator
4417 yeah and it was just like slavery i 'll bet too .
4418 conservatives are basically against anything and everything .
4419 the science is clear about sugar , but it does not advocate a specific policy like this tax .
4420 you misspelled rapeslaveryatgunpoint bro .
4421 who knew that free speech would begin it 's decline on college campuses ?
4422 this is what republicans are resorting to , picking the irs which is close to universally hated and impeaching the commissioner to gain support .
4423 because it is n't a disease ?
4424 the tsa should be abolished .
4425 the only thing that gun violence , is more guns .
4426 naturally as corporate media cnn has a fixation with `` democratic socialism '' and a blindness to the new deal as well as the real current issues facing the american people .
4427 fuck , if this had been a democrat , politifact would have switched income in for wages and said mostly true .
4428 least disturbing thing about ben carson .
4429 how diabolically clever she must be to keep escaping your clutches
4430 they would socialize the fedora sector of the economy .
4431 i 'm sure this thread will be great and have a good discussion .
4432 great , now the clams are out for blood
4433 they just need to get trump to fly to dallas .
4434 when they subtract the 2.5m illegal votes , it 'll be about even .
4435 do n't worry , melania trump is gong to put a stop to bullying !
4436 i 'm sure it 's only because of all of those illegals who voted .
4437 yes , but more would support trump repealing it if you subtract the illegals that voted in the poll .
4438 o rly ?
4439 i did n't realize it was the trumpers who were all `` feelz before realz . ''
4440 dope user name
4441 hey well at least we are replacing public schools with corporate-run charters , that should totally help to teach critical thinking skills .
4442 that 's why we must rid ourselves of the scourge of obamacare .
4443 everyone be sure and thank her for the trump administration .
4444 this deal sounds like `` economic recovery theater ''
4445 grab your tinfoil has boys and girls , i think he 's onto something !
4446 from the nationalized fed
4447 but the electoral college is about making sure everyone 's vote matters , no matter where they live , guys .
4448 i mean what else is he going to do until jan 20 ?
4449 then he will blame the economy and deficit on the democrats and the same people that voted for him will believe him .
4450 could someone tell me how this old loon is still relevant ?
4451 wonder how long it 's going to take for them to figure out how badly they got played .
4452 huffpost is fake news .
4453 wow , it 's almost like he 's a big fucking liar .
4454 this is fascism , if you agree that the editor should be jailed you are a fascist .
4455 who stashed the pod under sarah 's bed ?
4456 or perhaps ... it 's trump ?
4457 now can we call him a nazi ?
4458 trumps just going to let putin walk on him like a doormat now
4459 but lets just keep cutting education funding
4460 welp , seems i have found my religion/church .
4461 bin laden thought the same way
4462 as a worker , it feels great to know taxes are being handed out of my paycheck to be sent back to the corporation that i help produce profits .
4463 trump should , of his own accord , take to twitter to denounce this bullshit .
4464 giuliani could do to diplomacy what scarborough has done to journalism !
4465 trump has small fingers so he can only do small tricks .
4466 because they sure did well by cozying up to the republicans .
4467 this is what it has come to , the potus refusing to release a budget because he does n't want the american public to know where he really stands on the issues , and that working and middle class people are about to get fucked by a giant red , white and blue dick .
4468 i 'm looking forward to the next big terrorist attack , and the `` shocking '' news that a warning was in a missed briefing ( again ) .
4469 well i have to give it to pence for being introspective for a change .
4470 yeah but snowden is n't a republican so clearly what he did was worse .
4471 i ca n't wait for it to trickle down like when reagan was president !
4472 oh that would be just horrible !
4473 i really , really want off of this ride .
4474 this is what happens when you get your international relations degree from trump university .
4475 geez whiz , you got ta love those second amendment people !
4476 well , it 's been a while since last us president was assassinated .. this one is not one yet but i am sure he is pissing off the wrong people ..
4477 gee ya think ?
4478 well all blacks live in the inner city soooo ....
4479 new housing requirements , all homes must have a picture of the owner sitting in a chair with jesus at his side .
4480 10/10 diplomatic skills
4481 i trust paul ryan .
4482 it is not a hate crime when whites are attacked .
4483 shhh , do n't you know that the ar stands for assault rifle !
4484 not if the gay fish people who did 9/11 have anything to say about it ... !
4485 i know , let 's throw up the b signal and see if we can call gwb away from his painting in this hour of greatest need
4486 think of all the jobs hes creating in law enforcement !
4487 these single parents should have kept her knees together if she did n't want to pay higher taxes .
4488 should 've voted more than once , like all the people trump said did vote multiple times
4489 aww , how sweet of them .
4490 in 2 years , people are going to be so fed up with trump 's mismanagement that the house will swing back democratic .
4491 boeing needs to sue him before he takes office .
4492 the trumps are so shameless in their corruption , i 'm holding out hope that the entire family ends up in prison when the donald gets impeached .
4493 and spent in on trump brand clothing !
4494 hope she wins the election !
4495 can we stop calling them `` fiscal conservatives '' now ?
4496 lmao
4497 ca n't wait for those healthcare premiums to go back down once it 's repealed .
4498 and then has his hedge fund quickly invest .
4499 is there even a solution anymore ?
4500 i really want to see the shareholders take him to court and get a big payout .
4501 nah nah correlation is not causation those states just have more `` urban thugs ''
4502 yeeeaaaaaaahhhhh , but this sample size is crazy small to draw this sort of conclusion , especially considering a number of states without background checks had no shootings ( such as nh , me , and vt ; a full half of new england )
4503 wow what a fucking surprise sure was a good idea to elect him as president
4504 and this is why conservatives think liberals are children .
4505 the corruption and collusion matter a lot more to me than who was behind exposing it .
4506 carson says a lot of scary things .
4507 i ca n't wait for this level of micromanaging in my life !
4508 those women and children should buy some guns to protect themselves .
4509 see also : brownshirts .
4510 it could n't happen to a nicer yellow journalist .
4511 i 'm sure some climate deniers out there take that `` stance '' ( quoted because it 's really a fact ) just because the gop does , without actually doing any research themselves .
4512 too little too late
4513 cke wants to replace its cooks with robots
4514 liberals are happy they ended michigan recount because double counted ballots in hillary clinton counties would show she would have lost thousands of votes .
4515 great , that conformation and other biases magically only affect the left .
4516 when they go low , we go lower , amiright ?
4517 that last name though ... i have so many jokes forming in my head i think i 'm getting a headache .
4518 at this rate even with the three million illegal votes ( / to the fucking s ) hillary would still hold a lead .
4519 well i did n't see that coming !
4520 are you calling me a 'twat ' ?
4521 he also started talking about something to do with 3/5ths , but someone quickly shushed him and we did n't get to hear more
4522 yeah wired , tell me all about how solar fricken roads are going to save mankind .
4523 the part-time president .
4524 yeah , but he did n't give speeches to goldman sachs , so it 's ok .
4525 trump totally cares about these people !
4526 if you listen to the alt-reich , all of the progress in the world was done by white men , and media portrayals of women and people of color as heroes is just unrealistic pandering that attacks the foundation of their white supremacist worldview .
4527 ha , they 'll all go see it and just pretend to each other that they did n't .
4528 holy shit that is beyond stupid
4529 lol i thought the election could never be hacked obama
4530 is that like the only bank that he knows about ?
4531 do n't listen to this guys , the bbc and cbc are obviously fake news sites and controlled by the evil corporate american msm !
4532 then trump clearly deserves as much protesting as possible .
4533 this is the equivalent of 8 or 9 missed security briefings .
4534 tillerson was awarded the order of friendship by putin himself , that is a tremendous character reference for the sos position .
4535 i for one welcome our crony capitalist utopia
4536 member when people were worried about a few fucking generic speeches at goldman sachs ?
4537 \ # partybeforecountry
4538 great observation !
4539 alot of honest political discussion here in the comment section
4540 i for one am excited for our new comrade in cheif .
4541 the fbi did n't seem so sure either .
4542 good thing we have those bright guys at the cia to keep up with this for our idiot soon to be president .
4543 weird , how did they get around that $ 2700 maximum ?
4544 more like he would of been losing billions if he had stayed in business
4545 i 'm sure he 'll take that well and respond reasonably .
4546 opinion peices need to be labeled as such and not be touted as actual news .
4547 how many of the 10 are democratic electors ?
4548 yeah , but he won 3 states by less than 1 % of the vote ( despite also not actually winning a majority ) so that does n't matter .
4549 i love lessons in reality from those who held onto the obama is a kenyan belief .
4550 i , too , find that all the least fake news about russia comes from the czech republic .
4551 confirmed : nameless blog pushes worthless headline
4552 do n't worry , just another false-flag
4553 republicans : the biggest * * death panel * * you ever saw .
4554 that was n't a recount .
4555 what a productive use of transition time !
4556 alex jones is * clearly * misinformed , it 's hillary that gets people assassinated .
4557 so now that he 's cooperating , he will release his tax returns and put this russia stuff to bed !
4558 is that before or after she ran a pedo fun club out of a dc pizzeria ?
4559 sucker
4560 bern it down !
4561 yea our new buddy russia , the winning , oh the winning
4562 she 's a nasty woman .
4563 and putting out tax records showing earned income from goldman was such evil .
4564 but guys , he held a flag once .
4565 it 's a good thing the ec are such an ethical bunch of guys .
4566 the bigly one .
4567 does n't look like anything to me .
4568 glad she thought it through when voting .
4569 signed , stamped , and dropped in the mail .
4570 2nd amendment patriots , am i right ?
4571 # drain the swamp
4572 it will be fine , he is a progressive .
4573 well , he was a false flag manchurian puppet set in motion by hillary and polestar and the rand corporation so it does n't matter
4574 it 'll be interesting to see just exactly how he 's gon na enforce that .
4575 now alex is part of the conspiracy .
4576 ... and i 'm sure that bernie is close to becoming the democratic nominee .
4577 okay then .
4578 no , trump supporters are n't racist at all .
4579 thanks donald !
4580 who could have possibly foreseen that anyone associated with the gop would ignore intelligence reports and put our nation at risk for their own gain .
4581 well , it 's not like trump would ever apologise either , so does that also qualify him as someone with integrity ?
4582 what 's wrong with dividing the world between the us and russia ?
4583 and somehow giving his companies to his kids will fix the conflict of interest ?
4584 probably trying to squeeze in some heinous legislation before they lose the governor
4585 i 'm sure his business interests wo n't influence his decision making at all
4586 yeah but at the same time putin is making them hard
4587 can you think of someone else who 's been lying a lot who should perhaps be arrested ?
4588 it 's always pleasant to see would be dictators * always * announce their intentions before they do something .
4589 they should visit russia , it might help them appreciate how great putin is doing .
4590 withholding aid has been successful in getting north korea and cuba to change their ways also .
4591 the reason the obama administration did n't do anything before the election about the russian hack is because they thought it would benefit the democrats .
4592 when you have a president-elect who routinely praises vladimir putin , talks about lifting russian sanctions , signals a willingness to recognize the crimean referendum , and suggests abandoning nato countries who do n't meet defence spending quotas , it 's going to raise some eyebrows .
4593 so they used wikileaks ?
4594 itt : the cult of the donald has a couple of incredibly level headed , reasonable , and completely logical opinions .
4595 they do n't care about facts at all , they live in their own made up reality , it would be hilarious if they did n't fuck the rest of the world while they do that .
4596 gop to reid : get rekt , we do n't give a shit .
4597 there should be an affirmative action program for cabinet posts , this way lil wayne could be secretary of state and g-unit could head the department of defense .
4598 why not use a tag that label them for what they are : lies and propaganda ?
4599 yeah but `` sticking it to the washington elite '' was worth it !
4600 let me add another question : `` why did you vote for someone who admitted to buy politicians ? ''
4601 i believe it
4602 itt : people continuing to deny trump is racist and emboldens a lot of racists , and a lot of people valiantly demonstrating otherwise only to be ignored .
4603 i think i 'm getting the black lung , pop
4604 this will surely be the winning strike from the left .
4605 but the files were not on an email server so it 's all good .
4606 small government , big ceos
4607 hope that we can ban muslims and deport millions !
4608 we need more businessmen in government to fight for the working class , right trump voters ?
4609 i 'm sure wells fargo will pay for their crimes and actions under a trump administration .
4610 too easily faked , as we can see with obummer
4611 he 's waiting so he can appoint them as federal judges .
4612 california is 1/6th of our country .
4613 say it with me folks , `` no shit sherlock '' .
4614 i think that 'd be the furthest thing from patriotic .
4615 some hard-hitting investigative journalism .
4616 they 'll never blame republicans , but it 's a form of scadenfreude
4617 to anyone with any even small connection to any african american community , this is like saying water is wet .
4618 what a pathetic man .
4619 when did the democrats start chasing white voters ?
4620 yea we probably have another one
4621 what a populist !
4622 ahhh ceos are the anti christ ... making sure the business stays afloat to pay its employees .
4623 oh wow whatever shall we do !
4624 so with the 3 million illegal votes factored in , trump still won the popular vote !
4625 because trump supporters are consequentialists .
4626 this was actually the result of chinese hackers , so it does n't count .. move along , nothing to see here .
4627 shut up and go away - i say this a democrat .
4628 they are n't wrong .
4629 the russians did it .
4630 the opposite goes for democrats .
4631 once again obama is on point .
4632 hey now do n't come at nate cardboard like that , he admitted that he was super wrong and stuff jeez !
4633 reddit is trusting polls now ?
4634 does everyone 's vote have the same weight in this poll or are 4 ny votes equal to one from wyoming ?
4635 because everybody knows the republicans are all angels .
4636 not being able to force normal people to humour your fetish does not equate to a crackdown on your rights .
4637 well that 's useful .
4638 my party has a lot of wankers .
4639 so much small government
4640 democrats need to bring their electors to heel .
4641 obviously you do n't know that its america spirit that 's keeping him alive , similar to dick cheney ; he wants to maga to further strengthen the energy and gain immortality .
4642 yes but you need to send jill stein cash money
4643 what a shock
4644 maybe he thinks surrounding himself with billionaires will make him a billionaire .
4645 merican taliban , fuck yea
4646 so you 're saying that partisanism is a partisan issue ?
4647 i 'm sure if it was reversed they would want to get rid of the ec
4648 a little late there bud .
4649 well who the hell else are going to save us from xenos , the thirsting gods of chaos and the horrors from the dawn of time , sure as fuck is n't tim kaine and `` throw me in the van like a side of beef '' clinton .
4650 but blue lives matter more !
4651 ~~conspiracy theories ... ~~ fake news
4652 gee wonder what else could have driven comey to reopen the probe and subtly announce it to the gop .
4653 1st rule of the patriarchy : it 's always women 's fault .
4654 to misquote jason bourne : there is no measure to how hard and how fast trump supporters will ignore this .
4655 when can we just start calling him the `` conman in chief ''
4656 so the real us leader was in the room , so ok
4657 but hey , at least we do n't have hillary in office .
4658 is there anyone who is not completely full of shit ?
4659 relax none of us can be racist for like a month , we all have a black president .
4660 that 's all part of `` gods plan '' .... fucking
4661 wow ... you guys really are desperate .
4662 who could have seen this coming ?
4663 the other 38 % must be the independents who * want * the dems to keep losing everything .
4664 i 'm just waiting for an article titled `` trump beat clinton if californians and new yorkers only count for 3/5 of a vote ! ''
4665 lol less than that if you count in the 4 faithless electors .
4666 will it have an exposed exhaust port as well ?
4667 this is such a non issue no american wants to do these jobs so they need the temp workers from mexico
4668 this makes me feel lonely and sad
4669 they 'll all just be acts of god , proof that he is punishing us for electing a kenyan muslim as president !
4670 finally , i can get back to discriminating against the lgbtq people , with obama gone it did n't make sense being a racist anymore .
4671 what kind of meth is she smoking ?
4672 may ?
4673 they dum .
4674 a gofundme effort can not be far behind .
4675 yeah , aretha franklin singing at inauguration , how classless .
4676 once the camps are built , there will be plenty of jobs .
4677 good thing the trumplings did n't vote for the candidate that wanted war !
4678 yeah but at least lincoln was pro-life , anti-tax , and politically incorrect !
4679 we got ta make sure we can destroy all the insects too .
4680 yeah , it really lends weight to the whole `` i voted for trump because hillary is a warmonger '' argument .
4681 is putin trump 's new chief of staff ?
4682 god have mercy on our souls
4683 we have heavily fortified bunkers , if you do n't than that 's your fault
4684 but , her emails !
4685 it is remarkable how he continuously dissapoints me .
4686 it 's like watching a really shitty movie somehow got a reboot , but with a director even shitter than the first one .
4687 trump supporters are already further enabling the `` us vs them '' mentality by regurgitating his rhetoric .
4688 because it 's going to all trickle down to the masses .
4689 nah , he 's super smart .
4690 thought you knew that if obama did it , it was only ok if a goper did the exact same thing
4691 the libural thought police is at it again !
4692 the first hooker 's allowance must not be big enough .
4693 horrendous
4694 stay classy gop
4695 it 's ok when a republican does it .
4696 when they go low we go lower
4697 i am sure the bernie or busters with student debts that were saying how trump is no different than clinton must be happy now .
4698 lets play the whose the most terrifying person in the incoming trump regime besides the orange monster himself .
4699 i feel bad for the veterans .
4700 guys before we judge trump let 's nothing forget hillary has a foundation too .
4701 so aimed at democrats .
4702 no , they are draft dodgers
4703 yes , let 's go back to the gilded age where teenagers worked in factories for pennies an hour !
4704 just remember since labor is 100 % of the costs of a product the cost of a good will increase yugely !
4705 but he appeared on tv because he 's wildly successful , not because he needed the money
4706 how is this news ?
4707 this is the 5th thread with exact same title .
4708 man , does this guy always look like this , or did they manage to snap the most evil looking shot they could of him ?
4709 should wilbur ross be working for the benefit of the british people ?
4710 cnn telling you what to do and think ... definitely not fake news
4711 sounds like obama is just a sexist berniebro to me
4712 all of them but his
4713 as is the u.s. , as well as israel
4714 bill clinton was very wrong , and still is .
4715 i like bernie , i just do n't think he could win .
4716 trump seems mad that he was n't invited to the `` cool kids '' club .
4717 `` if you think hiroshima was good , just wait until you see what trump has planned . ''
4718 but both sides should get equal coverage , as they both have valid points .
4719 i agree with the sentiment that we should boot the un from american soil , just not for the reason given in the article .
4720 this is clearly trumps fault .
4721 family values
4722 oh , so he 's smart !
4723 hey now , god changed his mind about black people back in '78 .
4724 only because they do n't have enough guns , apparently , according to the theory of more guns equals more safety
4725 # lugenpresse do n't be fooled fellow centipedes i swear there are so many unfunny similarities with how fascist parties come to power it 's unreal
4726 and there 's also absolutely no way russia interfered in the election .
4727 i bet he just has dirt on all of them and they are cowards .
4728 oh , that completely changes things , he was only going to be racist in private .
4729 i think we should change the color of upvotes .
4730 judging by his mustache , i 'd have guessed it was something pizza related .
4731 the pentagon will love this logic .
4732 yeah , but he 's such a strong leader though
4733 thanks obama !
4734 i 'm sure that wo n't cost the taxpayers more money
4735 ah , yes , we all remember the success of the 2nd indochina war .
4736 i propose an empirical test of this assertion .
4737 wow , i 'm so glad that weed smokers will get what they deserve for harming so many people .
4738 or they could be trying to lower premiums for everyone else
4739 if my wife dies because we ca n't afford her expensive cancer drugs , i 'm going to make life a living hell for any republican responsible .
4740 can we call the people that deny the results of the electoral college , election deniers ?
4741 * holds
4742 but trump would never lie !
4743 but it does n't matter because , you know , gerrymandering .
4744 no way , whites were slaves all this time , i just did n't know
4745 take your time , trump , do n't overexert yourself .
4746 and if anything goes wrong under trump it 'll be obama 's fault .
4747 and now we 're claiming that the emails are why hillary lost ... which is why trump is mirroring the behavior they harped on .
4748 what is the worst that could happen ?
4749 as long as it 's him , with enough fuel for a one way trip .
4750 c'mon guys , whats wrong with the ceo of one of the largest oil companies in the world who has strong russian oil interests ?
4751 so this thread has +300 comments and only 33 upvotes ... seems legit
4752 i just want black genocide .
4753 these people will be targeted for retribution , mark my words .
4754 i think if you voted for trump you should be required by law to give up a female in your family for the great leader to pussy grab .
4755 fox news and their endless mission to make the middles hate the poors , but please pay no attention to the rich behind the curtain .
4756 happy to oblige , actually .
4757 this restaurant will be closed within 6 months .
4758 the us has been committing acts of war for decades , most of it unjustified .
4759 oh shit , what 're derek zoolanders dad and brothers gon na do ?
4760 ah yes , segregation was so great .
4761 and you think they might know a bit about security
4762 to be fair , i think he 's talking genuine attacks , not ones prefabricated by him and his friends .
4763 if oregon is good enough for the goonies , it 's good enough for me .
4764 they might as well just start shooting at protestors from the rooftops , for all the attention they pay to the law .
4765 is moore one of them ?
4766 * * the atf , looking out for * you * 24 x 7 since waco * *
4767 shocking ...
4768 a large collection of white people is automatically racist ?
4769 the supreme court overturned busing , it 's no longer okay to bus them to better schools .
4770 yea ... better go with obama .
4771 firefighters , who need firefighters , give me big cooperation 's any day .
4772 because 6 corporations control all the media in the usa .
4773 if a chris wallace makes things up in the middle of a broadcast , and no one is around to hear it ( because they 're all at church ) , does he still make noise ?
4774 do n't worry sarah will put on her brass bra and save us all !
4775 also a compelling argument to leave religion behind in history 's dustbin .
4776 dont know if you know this , but homosexuality is a confirmed mental disorder , and was only declassified in the 70s , at the peak of the `` sexual revolution '' by `` scientists '' whos lives were being threatened openly by homosexual activists .
4777 i 'm sure sure we just do n't have the full context of the situation .
4778 that will give romney some legitimacy .
4779 media used propaganda it 's super-effective !
4780 lets hear it for the cia , working since their inception to make the world less safe , and to short sightedly screw the us over .
4781 thanks goodness obama only wants to increase military spending by $ 2.05 trillion .
4782 and so it begins , watch this story get bigger if obama takes florida or disappear if mittens does .
4783 yea because it would be so awful if people were allowed to honor kill family members and not be able to get away with it , since its `` part of their culture '' .
4784 yep , we call that a push poll .
4785 must be some of those danged wimmens again !
4786 desperation at it 's finest .
4787 you lost the gop at `` facts '' .
4788 eh , i 'd rather pay more for real parts made in the united states than fake parts bought from china/taiwan .
4789 wow , just think of how many jobs those rich people will be creating now that their taxes are lower , because as sean hannity told me .... ten million times , he never got a job from a poor man .
4790 well i guess that 's one way to teach parents a lesson .
4791 he was just undercover as a drunk driver .
4792 what the fuck is wrong with texas anyway ?
4793 watch as all the wealthy people leave their beachfront california mansions and their manhattan penthouses in order to move to kansas and take advantage of this sweet deal !
4794 hell no , idiots with shitloads of money are what campaigns are built on !
4795 look at those paedophiles .
4796 they ca n't be terrorist , they ai n't muslim !
4797 ah yes , let 's look at the highest paid ones because that 's representative of most ceos
4798 but men actually have rights regarding their body , that would be unreasonable government regulation .
4799 they are in a better place now .
4800 are mixed marriages illegal also ?
4801 got ta have the troops home for the upcomming marshal law .
4802 only public schools mind , those charter schools can do whatever they want as long as they keep ponying up the donations to the gop .
4803 this just proves that the `` freedom '' america is long dead .
4804 i do n't think you can even argue mistake here , they were indifferent to whether the suspect was in the vehicle or not .
4805 us is doing harm to itself by bullying the world , holywood helped the world love americans , but in the last 2 decades , especially now , its all going to shit .
4806 the minimum wage needs to be 1 cent !
4807 i see no way for this to come back and bite him in the ass later
4808 only one of these things is a constitutionally protected human right .
4809 well if they had `` nothing to hide . ''
4810 now can we change this stupid fucking `` stand your ground '' law ?
4811 why would he do that
4812 that 's funny , because i do n't know how the ceo and executives live with themselves .
4813 of course , obamacare only helps those that vote democrats .
4814 from the number of times i have read about fines and settlements reached - monetary punitive measures really seem to be fucking working .
4815 this is the same guy that wants you to believe that his last name is not pronounced `` boner '' .
4816 the government should have let them fail too .
4817 no .
4818 got to get private money out of politics and legislation .
4819 what did that woman in oregon get ?
4820 just curious - what 's the difference between corporate totalitarianism and fascism ?
4821 to be fair , this $ 4000 million stadium probably brings in more economic activity than that
4822 if only obama would focus on raiding gun shops , then he could do some real good .
4823 well .. this is just horrifying .
4824 needs moar reagan !
4825 i 'm sure the corrupt politicains will all support this .
4826 does n't surprise me in the least .
4827 family values .
4828 ron paul is really the only guy that can admit our government could be in bed with the military industrial complex .
4829 but lets go ahead and invade again to kill isis .
4830 do you really think the country is faring well right now ?
4831 yes , because in a complex economic downturn synonymous with capitalism , you can do nothing but blame literally .1 % of people .
4832 if you guessed republican from a tobacco state , you win .
4833 americans , we scare easily and overreact in almost all situations .
4834 shocking !
4835 both parties are equally bad .
4836 ... aaaahnnddd that , folks , is how it works .
4837 `` party of personal responsibility ''
4838 they should build better bootstraps and quit whining like the liberals they are .
4839 color me shocked .
4840 yes , because certainly there were no increases in premiums * before * aca .
4841 but then how can i enforce my position in society , if everyone has food to eat !
4842 fear , hate , god and guns .
4843 do n't spend that kind of money on your weddings .
4844 breitbart logic : `` saw some anti-western graffiti on this wall , let 's kill them all ''
4845 worst thing to happen since 9/11
4846 so , in other words they have abolished two peoples student loan debts ?
4847 yeah , but it 's not fair because they ca n't gerrymander senate elections .
4848 beheadings next ?
4849 just a couple of bad apples .
4850 if we could stop the money , it would end .
4851 has arizona told us how they solved * * all * * their other problems before coming to this ?
4852 barack obama , makes himself king of the ocean .
4853 did he suddenly find his tax returns ?
4854 i hope `` the criminals '' do n't realize that upgrading to ios8 means `` the law '' ca n't touch them .
4855 but , but jesus and free markets and traditional families ?
4856 as a member of isis i support this policy .
4857 as long as it keeps the right people from voting .
4858 just call it a good shooting and move on .
4859 but ca n't decide which ?
4860 they tried wearing those identification bracelets , but the justice department took them away .
4861 clean water must cost money .
4862 oh i 'm sure obama is going to be real tough on his donors .
4863 surely you 're not trying to say an inquiry and declaring war are n't the same thing ?
4864 hateful bigoted speech is protected , until it is used to incite others to violence , aka breaking the law .
4865 why hav n't these guys dropped out yet ?
4866 well , in carson 's defense ... they both sank with all hands lost .... definitely
4867 something something ..... * devil 's money * .
4868 good thing he has such a strong grasp of climate change , evolution , and how to deal with an active shooter
4869 the poll has to be skewed , or something
4870 take middle class jobs with benefits and turn them into minimum wage walmart kiosk jobs that operate like the scammiest of debt collectors .
4871 let me guess ... nra and kkk as well ?
4872 well , at least this is n't a deeply biased hatchet job .
4873 they can already be senators and congressmen/women , so why not .
4874 oh great , more liberals controlling the minds of our youth
4875 ashley madison ?
4876 i know mitt romney was never this low , but were mccain or kerry ?
4877 bernie sanders did n't make that claim , wapo and other liars have .
4878 right , because young white males are the * * only * * demographic who think that states should be allowed to legalize cannabis .
4879 hillary is more hawkish then some of the gop candidates
4880 you should n't take acid and try to be president at the same time .
4881 maybe they need more tax cuts
4882 'hillary is a neo-con '' well that 's one way you republican types can sooth yourselves after she wins , hell sounds like a reason for you to vote her .
4883 so ?
4884 so take it off schedule 1 .
4885 do not trust !
4886 oh my god we are seconds away from obama and the city of hamtramck ushering in sharia law .
4887 carson says he is faces unprecedented scrutiny because the msm fear him and are disparate .
4888 question - if this happens so blatantly and they get away with it , what 's stopping them from doing this for the presidential and congressional elections next year ?
4889 r/politics covering for a democrat , now i 've seen everything .
4890 you only have the freedom to have married procreative sex .
4891 this just in , jimmy carter 's cancer defies science by not behaving like cancer !
4892 yeah ... look at costco and the container store ... they are in dire straits .
4893 illegals can not vote currently , this will not be an issue with outreach until progressive liberals provide non-us residents the right to vote and healthcare and yadda yadda
4894 want the last one reagan ?
4895 it 's because they are n't conservative enough
4896 next they will be telling us that is a photo of charles koch the great individual rights humanitarian as he , koch so recently went on television to claim .
4897 where is this in our constitution ?
4898 ben carson would destroy the nation fool .
4899 guess they 're the only ones not receiving kickbacks from the endemic corruption in the bloated us military system
4900 bernbots are fuming again !
4901 because he has very little chance of winning the nomination
4902 yes , because the gop that ca n't even pass a highway bill without simultaneously trying to deregulate wall street and not pay for half of it will go along with an infrastructure and health plan proposed by hillary clinton .
4903 he has a lot more voices in his head than anyone else in washington , so must have more information .
4904 yup this is what we would do if we want this war to never end .
4905 see , both parties are the same
4906 never seen a politician do that before .
4907 that would be nice and all if obama had actually been accepting christian refugees .
4908 except atheists , they 're the bastard children .
4909 trump duh
4910 good thing we are a republic and not a democracy
4911 small government ftw !
4912 these are the types of decisions better left to uneducated religious fundamentalits who run the local school boards .
4913 when your claims are n't historically accurate , change history !
4914 i was expecting , `` i went to isis and told them to cut it out . ''
4915 he 's trolling us with the plot to x-men
4916 and if trump builds that wall they will be stuck here .
4917 do n't tell me what to do !
4918 i thought that the first did n't end too well .
4919 to be honest though , it 's nice to know he 's actually capable to get a super pac .
4920 let 's wait for sanders to say the exact same thing so that it can get to the front page .
4921 because dylan roof was a leftist .
4922 sanders has the momentum !
4923 i 'm sure obama 's ongoing drone program and the thousands of civilian casualties it has created has * nothing * to do with creating more terrorists .
4924 i want to take risks .
4925 that reminds me , hillary touched me inappropriately at her last rally .
4926 yea , but trump just makes sense
4927 we should snapchat the combat , instagram the death and facebook the celebration .
4928 ted cruz is running ?
4929 i think we 're still talking about abortion because they * are * actually successfully pushing back abortion access in states they dominate , though .
4930 no wall , no vote .
4931 yes , because a nation should always prioritise having more wars than sports
4932 our republicans are such wholesome patriots abusing their own president is more important than working to improve their own nation .
4933 politics ?
4934 must mean they are for it .
4935 anyone who thinks the nsa has stopped bulk surveillance , is at best a moron .
4936 rubio is nothing more than a younger face on the same old , gop crap .
4937 but if the attacks happened in the uk , would n't they be the uk attacks ?
4938 thank you for the words , mike , we could n't have done it without you .
4939 there is a difference between 3 dead and hundreds do n't be a douche
4940 let the bodies cool before you make an agenda out of this , god damn .
4941 i wonder , now that it 's become clear what the shooter 's motives were , when cruz will condemn this act of christian terrorism .
4942 when it comes to preserving abortion rights , and women 's health , in this country , we can trust hillary .
4943 all christians need to say they do n't agree with this man !
4944 america was pretty great before slaves got their freedom
4945 but he 's draining the swamp !
4946 plz upbote me so i can bash this ass hole more my comments are getting dicked by the system
4947 is he putting us on notice ?
4948 my computer is safe .
4949 hopefully it is easier to convince him when it is a really important matter .
4950 starting at 8 years old , of course
4951 gosh , who could ever have guessed that someone who was a dick to the owner of a golf course would not be welcome at that golf course with open arms of friendship ?
4952 `` do n't worry , he wo n't touch social security or medicare , it 's just 4d chess ''
4953 ok , i am frightened by the conflict of interest in the incoming administration , but $ 420,000 is so minuscule on the scales of governments .
4954 well the internet is a liberal conspiracy in case you did n't already know , so king trump * should * do something about it
4955 of course that will automatically change under trump .
4956 because personal responsibility means only being accountable to yourself !
4957 i guess it make sense ... in the same line of thought as `` if u have nothing to hide , u should not worry about privacy '' ... in this case it is something like `` if we told you that we are ethical , there is no need for independent watchdog ''
4958 ah yes because the democrats are the bastion of integrity and honesty
4959 because ethics are for those goddamn liberals
4960 minimum wage workers will be saving tons of money in their freedom health savings account .
4961 however , the politician that put it into place was busted for cocaine possession .
4962 and net neutrality provides 'lousy internet ' !
4963 sounds like a mandate to me .
4964 well , trump demanded the market do as it 's told to do so trump still did it .
4965 if you fill the swamp with enough shit , is it still a swamp ?
4966 yeah that 's believable - does n't everyone tell the president of the united states that he has to wait or were not ready .
4967 well the intelligence agencies should forget to mention when/if an attack is coming at the white house `` president donald trump was killed today by a terrorist attack because he ignored intelligence briefings ... ''
4968 more fake news from the liberal msm .
4969 if only all the other democracies that failed had remembered to write checks and balances into their constitutions !
4970 yeah because obamacare sure did make health care affordable
4971 it 's okay , guys : i 'm sure this will be the moment when trump finally comes out against the white supremacists his election has emboldened !
4972 this just shows how bloated obamacare is
4973 i do n't know much about this guy besides what the article says , which is n't much .
4974 only the best for government work !
4975 it 's not like we needed that money for infrastructure or anything .
4976 luckily , alot of them are boomers who voted for trump , so its a self correcting measure
4977 the thing the trump presidency had too much of was intelligence
4978 swamping the drain .
4979 please stop censoring these news articles , mods !
4980 but t_d is satire and should have never been taken seriously so it does n't count
4981 me : why is kaine still a thing ?
4982 look at trump creating jobs !
4983 fake news .
4984 because fucking over 20 million americans was n't enough ; they want to fuck over women , too .
4985 remember only the clintons are crooked .
4986 the trump defenders have proved only one thing to us , no matter who got elected , they just want to watch the world burn .
4987 i for one welcome the sudden increase in teen pregnancy .
4988 what is cutting aid to mexico ?
4989 careful you 'll end up on the street
4990 in future history this will be regarded as the high point of him fulfilling his campaign promises .
4991 nah , it was the russians
4992 i wonder where the next goalpost will be .
4993 i 'm sure it 's just a coincidence .
4994 incorrect , do n't you know that they were created because businesses knew that trump would be elected ?
4995 yes and more information on how this will work to be revealed tuesday ... or maybe wednesday .
4996 ah this had nothing to do with obama # fucktrump
4997 yeah but then they already voted for it , so fuck them and theirv discomfort .
4998 it creates jobs , and that is not a bad thing , eh ?
4999 it 's only fair that trump have the russian national anthem played at his inauguration .
5000 wow , this two-minute-old reddit account is sure going to last a long time by posting things like this , with totally-not-made-up headlines .
5001 here you go , you forgot this .
5002 thanks trump voters .
5003 damn socialist god !
5004 trump has become kind of a national iq test for the 99 % .
5005 has the fart managed to fill his cabinet yet ? .... imagine no ambassadors in place on 21st jan 2017 ? .... is it the fart 's intention that anyone wanting to have a diplomatic discussion withe the usa having to send someone to the court of the fart or will just send the a tweet ?
5006 maybe someone will dox this reporter and we could follow him around and harass him .
5007 damn those russia hackers , they hacked the dnc to reward clinton loyalists .
5008 neither is the dnc .
5009 but shillary mailz !
5010 if only we had more people with guns , there would n't be as many shootings .
5011 mitch enjoys crapping on the `` little people . ''
5012 trump , the job killer
5013 bro , if they 're in the two comma club or the three comma club , why does it matter ?
5014 wonder how all the southern red state housewives who claim an undying love for meryl streep and all that she stands for feel about this .
5015 better get rid of planned parenthood .
5016 if has has n't progressed past a small child in 70 years , i seriously doubt he can in the minute amount of time he has left to plague this earth .
5017 when all your friends tell you to run for president and you turn out to be the most destructive weapon russia ever used against the usa
5018 republicans have n't had time to recalibrate for the next bogeyman
5019 i know , like that time a real estate huckster kept saying crazy stuff about the president 's birth place .
5020 more from a narcissist trying to remain relevant .
5021 you know its a reliable news website when the site name sounds like a the_donlad username lmao
5022 how can he do these things before he 's inaugurated ?
5023 i thought frankfort was the capital of ky .
5024 what 's his end game , here ?
5025 someone needs to tell schumer and the dems to grow up !
5026 i guess her acting abilities have slipped pretty quickly over the past few years .
5027 bristol palin : a class act .
5028 gon na miss obama ... i hope he 'll be more blatantly vocal once he 's no longer prez .
5029 america , home of the free
5030 oh the white supremacist also has other ethical violations , color me shocked .
5031 it 's spelled unpresidented you dumb lib
5032 a tweet is about as political as this sub .
5033 areligious people continue to be one of the most underrepresented political groups in america .
5034 to be fair sessions and the gop members on the panel were also wearing kkk robes , so maybe they were just trying to fit in .
5035 yeah , we really should make an effort to bring back polio .
5036 but i 'm pretty sure obama was the anti-christ ....
5037 but he is in no way acting as an arbiter at all , interfering , or selectively releasing information for political purpose , no way .
5038 make america contagious again !
5039 but the russians are our friends they would never act against us interests !
5040 you know full well this is obama 's fault !
5041 this just in , r kelly has agreed to perform at the inauguration .
5042 fake news !
5043 of course he sided with russia , it 's what you do when you 're being blackmailed .
5044 of course they are saying that .
5045 here comes the shitshow to keep his cronies sucked around his cock , next thing he 's gon na say is `` obama set me up '' and then it 'll be checkmate .
5046 yeah , just look at ann coulter !
5047 the man thinks he is doing god 's work , a pile of petitions ai n't gon na change his mind or his course of action .
5048 ... and the piss rains down !
5049 huh , i did n't know mccain posted on 4chan
5050 you ca n't have your cake and eat it too .
5051 do n't worry , cnn published it so it 's not true .
5052 fuck cnn it is fake news no matter who you voted for
5053 but breitbart and infowars are beacons of truth
5054 how is it even possible to phrase his concept `` properly '' ?
5055 but hey breitbart is the best news source around , i mean just check out their conspiracy articles
5056 i am an american , and i * * do n't * * care about his tax returns
5057 what about marla maples ?
5058 but they wo n't lift a finger to address russian hacking and subsequent leaks ?
5059 i appreciate this but as i watched outnumbered to get my daily intake of their side , it was pretty insane the way they are rationalizing almost everything he does .
5060 so , they finally found that 4chan hacker guy i keep hearing about ?
5061 use facts for greater effectiveness .
5062 please explain why you believe people with preexisting conditions should be disallowed from having health insurance .
5063 cia also confirmed that the entire sexual act was completed inside of a vine video & amp ; nbsp ;
5064 this has to be a joke
5065 it will open up a lot of jobs .
5066 i 'm confused , are liberals for or against nato today ?
5067 wow between the russian hackers and the fbi , and probably nazis and white supremacists , i do n't know why people bother voting anymore
5068 yes , because this is what the country should be focused on right now .
5069 is this headline satire ?
5070 yeah but tnat 's assuming contractors will be paid .
5071 did trump watch her pee too ?
5072 in his first 2 yrs in office , obama dropped 25,000 bombs , most of any president .
5073 no guys it 's just fake news if it 's against trump in any way , fake i tell you
5074 grandpa gon na hook us up some tin cans and string then see what them ruskies can do !
5075 i 'm waiting for trump to make a misstep so bigly that russia just says fuck it and releases the video .
5076 ted nugent is hoping for an ambassadorship to thailand
5077 as long as they protect the aca
5078 millionaire 's what ?
5079 crooked betsy !
5080 yes sir mr putin , please do n't release the two girls and trump video .
5081 we are living in bizzaro-land
5082 so they can sing about jesus and how he 's the greatest being to have ever existed ?
5083 if you think this is something , wait till i tell you about the emails .
5084 sounds about right , trump realises there is benefit to being jingoistic but seems to generally think people who take part in protests or fight as part of the armed forces are 'dummies '
5085 -scoff-
5086 redstate upset that nobody knows who redstate is .
5087 `` horrible shape '' to trump = lots of blacks .
5088 he was just wishing him well five times over the course of the day
5089 who is michael dukakis ?
5090 fuck the gop
5091 obvious attempt at damage control .
5092 yeah , but who has more pickup trucks ?
5093 shocking .. the voice of the neo-nazis ( alt-right ) aligns with trump over a civil rights leader .
5094 i 've always said that the most genuine opinion any reporter can obtain from anyone is from a lobbyist while you 're buying him lunch .
5095 subtle !
5096 unpopular but ironically he is one of the most powerful in modern history , sad
5097 $ 1000 fine for someone on food stamps seems perfectly reasonable .
5098 can we pin these job losses on trump ?
5099 - abandon all hope ye who enter here
5100 of course not , because there are black people there
5101 of course it 's outrageous , his kind used to be payed much more back in those days
5102 i for one welcome our new russian overlords .
5103 do n't worry , they are only repealing obamacare not the aca
5104 talks or new instructions ?
5105 i 'm surprised that no one seems to question why a future senior official of the government call the ambassador of another country to schedule a phone call for a future date ?
5106 this is in * no way * related to how he 's putin 's lackey and is staffing his cabinet with similar putin lackeys .
5107 oh you mean `` anyone part of the liberal establishment want to chime in ? ''
5108 to be fair , then we 'd be even for saving them in ww2 .
5109 more like pants on fire false , but ok ?
5110 it 's not the aca that is being repealed , it 's obamacare !
5111 his twitter account ?
5112 way to state the obvious .
5113 we 're going to get everything and pay nothing
5114 thanks , obama .
5115 does n't he have a place in the new administration yet ?
5116 /thundering applause
5117 everyone knows these polls are not how the public really feels .
5118 oh , well that makes it ok then .
5119 that 's just smart business .
5120 it 'll trickle down .
5121 ah yes the gop taking trump 's words to heart , `` grab her by the pussy . ''
5122 glorious 115 % approval ratings !
5123 brought to you by the same people who told us hillary had a 98 % chance of winning .
5124 74 % of people are journalists .
5125 but he knows it when he sees it !
5126 it 's totally not coming from the russians
5127 still , he does n't get it , he 's white .
5128 yes , that 's why obama failed .
5129 the final vote count was in the margin of error for the polling so the polls were n't inaccurate , you can blame specific pundits and analysts for being too generous with clinton 's odds , but the numbers were less than a percent off the final result also a lack of polling in certain states
5130 lol thats not true at all & amp ; those site are full of rigged fake news
5131 which side makes them money ?
5132 ca n't have these pesky externalities interfering with growth !
5133 i 'm shocked that more people are n't excited about our president being a reality television star who has never paid taxes or held any form of office .
5134 sounds very free market to me .
5135 gr * eeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaa * t .
5136 but both sides are the same and hillary would have been so terrible
5137 better do it within three days jules
5138 just the typical american hyperbole .
5139 yes reminds me of the time whenever anyone would go against clinton and dws called up their boss to get them fired
5140 we need a puerto rican registry !
5141 trump tied to people who are rasist waat no way
5142 is this maga in action ?
5143 finally , we will be free from the obama care oppression .
5144 just like russia and north korea wonderful
5145 and north korea !
5146 because otherwise the crowds would be laughably tiny .
5147 but its cold right now
5148 oooh , while we are at it can we replace lethal injection with drawing and quartering ?
5149 he tweeted the following : `` if mcdonalds brings back the chicken fajita and the mcrib , i 'll definitely turn myself over . ''
5150 they should diversify to make li batteries .. then electric cars will boom ... then they can go back to installing brake cables .
5151 obama should resign today making joe biden the 45th potus just to ruin all of trump 's inauguration merchandise .
5152 yes becuase trump needs money
5153 ca n't let your guard down , he still has 2 more days to take all our guns and lock us up in fema camps .
5154 9 states legalized it while he was president , and he let them .
5155 is anyone surprised ?
5156 trump would privatize the military if it made him a buck
5157 i 'm sure trump will now give up his presidency because of this
5158 no conflict , no conflict , you 're the conflict !
5159 how dare he mooch off obama .
5160 that 's like me not finding some change in between the couch cushions , come on give the guy a break
5161 right , but taxing imports from certain countries wo n't .
5162 what self respecting hispanic would serve with him anyway ?
5163 i 've looked into the future , it 's the liberals fault .
5164 wow , this will surely go over well .
5165 why do republicans hate anything remotely intellectual or democratic ?
5166 no , trump will allow good art - portraits of him , portraits of cowboys and soldiers , portraits of battle scenes - maybe even that art of the dallas cowboys as cowboys .
5167 my cousin has a phd in english literature , works for google , and has a million pound flat in london .
5168 maybe china will stop protecting them
5169 well , no one can doubt his experience in the drug trade !
5170 very professional of him .
5171 does this guy also happen to own cnn ?
5172 no they should be forced to watch , `` clockwork orange '' style .
5173 yeah , because the democratic party is such a bastion of intellectualism .
5174 i 'd like to believe this guy 100 % , but something tells me we are missing a few relevant facts .
5175 electing a shitty human being to be president , this is going to end well
5176 how can.he have an approval rating before he does anything
5177 if obamacare is more popular than trump , imagine the gap between trump and the affordable care act
5178 this is n't fake fucking news or anything .
5179 well that did n't take long .
5180 thank you , london !
5181 putin is laughing his ass off with all the protest going on .
5182 great job of uniting the country , donald
5183 well , if they 'd just die -- the gop 's hopes for america would be just so much easier .
5184 and yet not one of you cared about the clinton foundation taking in foreign money ?
5185 well all his cabinet nominations scream `` helping the little guy '' so far
5186 so he is honoring the majority of the peoples choice and stepping down ?
5187 russia is trumps america .
5188 well , if he has nothing to hide , he has nothing to fear , right ?
5189 pure fucking darkness .
5190 wonder who 's words he 's going to plagiarize ?
5191 right , better to just pick a better school than to put time and money into making them all better ... nothing bad will come of that .
5192 next h -- - jail i m confuse now : p
5193 very unfair !
5194 fake news !
5195 renters are always victims .
5196 at least he does n't have ties to putin
5197 no comrade , you are getting the facts confused again .
5198 so are we just gon na let him get away with that ?
5199 but but trump supporters had to work that 's why they were n't there
5200 if he was a real man he would grab her pussy and piss on her face .
5201 this will not be a popular position to take
5202 naww , did n't make it to become uks ambassador but uncle murdoch gave him a little job , how nice .
5203 really tired of seeing `` could '' in these news articles .
5204 it 's nice to see 100,000 reporters coming together .
5205 even if he did want medicare for all it would be a miracle for congress to pass that .
5206 to take the filters off , this makes it hard for someone who ca n't afford a $ 250k home from buying a $ 250k home .
5207 only white people have families , blacks just have illegitimate kids .
5208 and george soros paid each of these protesters 3,000 bucks !
5209 but obama was the censorship dictator !
5210 they are rino 's !
5211 see , cnn definitely has a liberal bias , just like trump said , they are just out to get him .
5212 all roar no bite , at least where it counts , at the voting booth .
5213 c'mon , they would n't do that .
5214 but why would the ~~ministry of truth~~ press secretary lie ?
5215 i do n't recognize the source - is there a track record of legitimate reporting ?
5216 if we ever see pop and obama hanging out then you know its on .
5217 this episode of black mirror is going too far .
5218 about the same size as trumps inauguration right there
5219 i 'm sure they were all hoping , perhaps rooting for casualties today
5220 just another waste of paper .
5221 state media yayyy
5222 we are not going to stop asking for it though buckle up buckaroo .
5223 how about you go back to australia , nicky .
5224 after trump 's inauguration of course !
5225 phew , i am glad we cleared that up .
5226 i 'm sure madonna is a credible threat .
5227 so is this good for weed ?
5228 if i type allahu akbar will they write an article about me ?
5229 a lot more people were home watching tv , unemployed 8 years ago .
5230 they forgot : * took trump 's twitter fights to a whole new level on national tv by extending them into a press conference .
5231 this could realistically start an actual jihad against the us .
5232 way to get taken for a ride by known liberal hacks pew research guys !
5233 `` planned parenthood repealed '' - trump
5234 good to see they are focused on the important issues .
5235 so glad they care !
5236 but america first !
5237 yeah , but those people are mostly poor , black or disabled , so it 's all good !
5238 experts , academics , and intellectuals are all in on it .
5239 eh , even being pro-choice i 'm not sure if it 's a good use of money to fund international abortions .
5240 ask the payroll department for where i work , they definitely know the answer !
5241 ernie will have a great time with this i hate my state government
5242 totally no difference between the parties !
5243 you ca n't tax or draft an aborted person .
5244 at what point does the pentagon just coup .
5245 `` you all know that the 3rd saturday in january is protest day , right ? ''
5246 united states is best america .
5247 what a sad whiny little bitch , how does anyone not suffering a servere brain disorder support this clown ?
5248 he must have wished him a very , very , very , very very merry christmas
5249 donnie , you really need to stop posting on reddit and get around to the business of governing .
5250 lock him up .
5251 i am sure his plans are nuanced and well-thought out .
5252 trump doesnt care .
5253 well is certainly helping our farmers/agricultural industry out .
5254 oh good , next time conservatives will get to gripe about actual economic anxiety .
5255 yes , it 's all about him .
5256 list the technologies , products and services that are sole creations by china that will make it dominant .
5257 the coal folks in those swing states must be so excited that all of this oil will be flowing into the us
5258 he does n't really want the job and he trying to do what he can to get out .
5259 the keystone pipeline will go right over nebraska 's drinking water supply , but i am sure canadian oil is more important than drinking water .
5260 `` so let 's cut taxes further '' said the least intelligent people .
5261 literally destroying democracy
5262 so be it if dapl goes forward .
5263 reporters should hang a picture of the crowd from the back to counter .
5264 yea , but that 's only because people who illegally voted were polled .
5265 yea , but those millions were illegal voters so they do n't have a say in the matter
5266 `` right now the focus is putting americans back to work '' amid lowest-unemployment numbers in years .
5267 thanks obummer .
5268 california , small state , no jobs , sad !
5269 thanks stein voters .
5270 this is very surprising to me .
5271 i expect all those conservatives who are outraged about executive orders to get really pissed now , lol .
5272 hmm , glad to have this stunning insight from rush limbaugh 's myspace page .
5273 what do we do with incivil source material ?
5274 they were n't from lifezette or breitbart so they obviously were n't really journalists .
5275 this is really interesting , given the fact that the narrative of obama being trigger happy when it came to executive orders circulated through even liberal circles .
5276 donald did say he was interested in going to mars , did n't he ?
5277 good .
5278 tax dollars well spent
5279 finally , those fema camps that conservative 's swore obama was going to use to round them up are going to be put to good use .
5280 ok and 97 % of scientists agree on global warming , so what ?
5281 what a wonderful use of tax money
5282 this is obviously the best way to cut down on wastage in government .
5283 gee , i sure do love my state !
5284 that should tell americans something .
5285 oh no , madonna is done now
5286 sounds like they want to make sure that their big oil and gas buddies interests are not impeded .
5287 well bannon is not an illegal so i guess it 's ok
5288 yeah , but he could n't push it over the arbitrary 20k mark - that was all trump .
5289 well ... he needs some place to put the journalists .
5290 it is so weird how speculation is now considered news .
5291 it 's reassuring to know that it 's actually bill o'reilly that 's shaping policy !
5292 what would they know !
5293 so why was obama forced to use some hacked up blackberry and this guy gets to do what he wants ?
5294 wow , i for one am thoroughly shocked
5295 he is probably hard at work setting up a new 'classy walls , llc ' company under baron 's name to award contracts to .
5296 history books will cite this as one reason for the 2nd american civil war , the conservatives willful rejection of consensual reality .
5297 hahahaha
5298 they 're not fake truths , theyre alternative facts .
5299 he 's such a great businessman though !
5300 obvious self-promoted trump circle jerk is obvious .
5301 damn politics content is really getting better .
5302 we need to make sure that the science is alternative science .
5303 how about `` trump first , then you other fucks can have the scraps .
5304 hillary and trump are totally the same .
5305 maybe we could auction these off to pay for the big beautiful fence extension .
5306 he 's gon na build a fire wall
5307 noooo but the emailsssss
5308 another nail in our coffin
5309 they will need to finish the audit of it first .
5310 is this what they mean by peer-review ?
5311 but alternative facts say that illegal border crossing is at an all-time high !
5312 the fact that i feel economic anxiety and blindly blame mexicans and you wo n't just let me do that without mocking my paranoia is why trump won !
5313 it was easy , they were all counted when they registered to vote for hillary clinton in the states she needed it the least
5314 the wall just got 10 feet higher
5315 most likely never .
5316 but , the time for unity is now .
5317 tell me more about how trump changed the doomsday clock
5318 it 's telling when the _donald trashbuckets avoid threads like these .
5319 yo i heard trump was born in kenya .
5320 at this point , i wo n't rule anything out .
5321 well , at least he is president
5322 impeach the mother fucker already
5323 if we are to accept the idea that the slogan is a racist dog whistle , meaning make america how it was in the 50s again before social liberalism began to take hold , then we can conclude the cutting ties with brown people will in fact make america great again .
5324 i 'm sure new hampshire and vermont must be a blood bath due to having the most lax gun laws in the country .
5325 and in related news , captain queeg proves beyond the shadow of a doubt and with ... geometric logic ... that a duplicate key to the wardroom icebox did exist , and that he would have produced that key if they had n't of pulled the caine out of action .
5326 period .
5327 no one is saying that the government should punch nazis .
5328 that oughta really help the us businessman .
5329 i 'm sure this wo n't affect prices of anything trump supporters buy .
5330 what need are their for petitions when we can have such great interactions with the tweeter in chief via twitter ?
5331 so purity test ?
5332 we are not north korea .
5333 wait why , this was when we needed her the most to keep her eyes on russia .
5334 to drain the swamp bro .
5335 lead singer of korn ?
5336 false flag , # fakenews , maga , right ?
5337 sauce ?
5338 they did n't spell it wrong , they used an alternative-spelling .
5339 commie donnie is done for .
5340 guess which former , recent president lived there ?
5341 trump has the most pathetic fragile ego .. i bet he threw a few temper tantrums when he realized obama was way more popular than he will ever be .
5342 i thought kim jung un was the sole source of truth .
5343 i 'm * shocked * lem me tell you
5344 what motherfuckers .
5345 what a hero .
5346 rigged polls clearly
5347 just rename planned parenthood to the center for the blessed mother .
5348 thank god , i was so worried about our military not being strong enough .
5349 jesus would be rejected because he was a jew .
5350 he did it because jews were n't the only ones involved in the holocaust , he 's a president for all , guys
5351 there 's an easy fix for addressing these problems - repeal the clean air and clean water acts .
5352 sooo , like 5 people ?
5353 i 'm sure the us military in those countries wo n't have any problems recruiting translators and guides there after this .
5354 i 'm sure it was those filthy clintons again .
5355 how many people are killed by a lack of affordable healthcare in the united states ?
5356 lock him up !
5357 i 'm sure they will follow the scripture and apply john 3:16 alone during the vetting process .
5358 any idiot who does n't think we should bring in refugees because they might be terrorists should ask themselves one simple question : if you wanted to go to another country and kill a bunch of people , why would you choose the slowest possible method of getting there ?
5359 lol hello fake news
5360 maybe google should hire americans then .
5361 fuck , stay out of controversial for once this is not fake news but they seem to be in support or think a left wing nut did it .
5362 yeah , worked out great for tony blair ...
5363 lol yes i can really see how a physical barrier between usa and mexico serves the israeli best interest
5364 no , just no !
5365 the mark of a person who is clearly not petty and just wants what 's best for everyone
5366 so his plan for isis was to tell people to make a plan for isis .
5367 right , with his big smart brain and tiny little hands .
5368 haha take that liberals !
5369 we 'll be annexing canadia soon .
5370 it is n't `` jews lives matter '' its `` all lives matter ''
5371 i bet this judge is a secret muslim
5372 oh , god .
5373 1:48 seconds in and they are talking about detention centers for immigrants that commit crimes ... that worked so well for us when we did it to the japanese , surely it 'll work this time too .
5374 george soros must have been really effective to mobilize all these people so quickly .
5375 left-wing telegraph at it again .
5376 i hear he has a yuuuge line of credit ... from a russian state-owned bank !
5377 now 300,000
5378 move on , nothing to see here .
5379 that sure sounds familiar .
5380 ya think ?
5381 when even boris johnson says you 're going too far .
5382 well , it 's her spare time , she can waste it as she pleases ...
5383 i ca n't take someone who thinks it 's been 12 years since 1995 seriously .
5384 but but stock markets soared when he was elected !
5385 but this has nothing to do with muslims !
5386 can we agree that protesting inside an airport is n't the best strategy ?
5387 trump hires only the best people
5388 soros probably paid them .
5389 good thing harry reid made it impossible to filibuster federal judges and obama left with over 100 vacancies .
5390 yeah but those 51 % are all illegal immigrants voting .
5391 i refuse to succumb to the chilling effect
5392 alcoholic moron usurps military .
5393 ignoring the law is called 'enforcing the law . '
5394 but i thought he knew more than the generals .
5395 ... and got us a crazy person elected instead , good job assange .
5396 but i thought statistics were lies not to be trusted anyway , right reddit ?
5397 america is reaping the fruits of republican party in complete control ... that 's what it is doing .
5398 while the rise was all due to trump , i 'm sure that the drop has to be obama 's fault .
5399 trump is cancer for american values .
5400 literally , 1 step forward , 2 steps back .
5401 there goes my holiday to mosul .
5402 having the rest of the developed world put a carbon tax on american exports will totally maga !
5403 it 's delta 's fault , obviously .
5404 ... are you putin me on , or just russian to judgement ?
5405 peter thiel as he 's loaded aboard the train to conversion camp , `` i took him seriously , but not literally ''
5406 `` because my specific situation causes me outrage , the premise of the law must surely be false '' ~ jeanyus asston kootcher .
5407 is tradeau some sort of australian trading company and why do they hate a mosque in quebec
5408 radical trumpist terrorist
5409 if this nation wants rich people then our citizens should do it the old fashion way , inherit it , like trump .
5410 well how else is a man expected to be an expert in something he does n't partake in ?
5411 are that still going to buy starbucks and use trumps name but that will really show them how you feel
5412 if you were wondering how he was so * sure * that there was voter fraud , now you know .
5413 but why own a gun if you ca n't even use it to make people fear you ?
5414 ca n't make this shit up .
5415 canadians should be extremely vetted !
5416 i think people should call trump hotels to let them know how they feel about trump 's conflicts and a muslim ban .
5417 wow i feel really good about jeff sessions checking him .
5418 he 's batshit crazy is n't he ?
5419 now we know who 's been shitting on the picnic tables at yellowstone , trump voters !
5420 we need a northern wall , fuck it lets just put a dome over america
5421 that 's just more `` alternative facts '' coming out of the orange house
5422 maybe he meant that gro_ing stuff ?
5423 man , the comment section is brutal .
5424 to be fair , toddlers * * have * * killed more people in the us than refugees .
5425 error 502
5426 yay more anti union legislation !
5427 yeah , but those jobs do n't count .
5428 how kind president trump , you are such a benevolent leader
5429 because all of god 's creatures need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps
5430 well it rhymes , it must be true !
5431 liberal activists are perverts and rapists , support president pussygrabber !
5432 r/politics is full of crybabies
5433 get ready for it for the next 4 years .
5434 but but he is a master negotiator ?
5435 but ... we were just peaking ... soaring on trump 's golden wings ... how could such sound analysis of fundamentals turn wrong so quickly ?
5436 oh they 'll be back supporting him with his sc pick because they are so pro-life , dontcha know .
5437 both sides are the same
5438 senator chris murphy ( d-ct ) tweeted that the vote was in violation of committee rules so is not valid .
5439 liberal hypocrites have no problem tearing down ambitious , assertive conservative women * * when everything that comes out of their mouth is a lie * * ftfy , now it 's truthful .
5440 yeah like that unfair media bias against hitler .
5441 and has already been confirmed to have only voted in one because thankfully all those states have voter id requirements ...
5442 hoping that you realize that it is illegal to fire officials using this particular avenue of dissent .
5443 no way ... this would require him to be totally full of shit .
5444 not 15 days in office and he 's taking vacations ... so good in the stamina department
5445 no big deal he would have put a stop on his check before they cashed it .
5446 if that were the case , trumpsters would be shambling up and down the streets bitching about how the election was rigged .
5447 that story does n't sound manufactured at all .
5448 just because they gave alternative numbers from their mouths does n't mean you can stop judging them by what 's in their hearts
5449 the repuke party should be named the liars club .
5450 i get your point but that picture makes me sick .
5451 they can move to the south side ...
5452 well , in their defense , they probably do n't know what `` interracial '' means .
5453 i knew this would be a contested election that would n't have a clear a winner for a while ... i 'm not saying there definitely was n't , but the problem with our system is you have to prove it ... pesky problem there
5454 this definitely is n't comparing apples and oranges at all
5455 of course he does ... from kenya !
5456 as deplorable as i think it is that homeless veteran benefits were cut , the nascar thing is advertising and it would utterly shock me if it did n't bring in a lot recruits .
5457 a link to a question on a twitter page gets you 3,547 upvotes ?
5458 well , to be fair i managed to not be taxed millions of dollars last year too .
5459 wow , did n't see that coming .
5460 wow , john kerry looks downright frightening in that picture .
5461 great things are happening in god 's chosen land .
5462 its photoshopped , i can tell by the pixels
5463 and your premiums are now ..... ?
5464 90 % of americans have no idea what the difference is .
5465 can i get an amen !
5466 why should development be paid for ?
5467 sarah who ?
5468 i 'm sure that cop will get paid suspension , like he deserves .
5469 is n't providing support to a foreign country over america considered treason ?
5470 coming from such a credible source i can not help but believe this is true !
5471 if only the democrats were in power everything would be just fine , there would have been no banking crisis , no housing market failure , no war in iraq , no indefinite detention , no patriot act , etc .
5472 about damn time they give us some rights back .
5473 of course they have .
5474 good read .
5475 my respect for mccain just increased greatly .
5476 as long as he did n't say `` vagina '' or else the michigan republicans would vote to silence him .
5477 well , i suspect his wrist felt mighty sore after that slap now did n't it ?
5478 good to know that taxpayer money is n't being wasted on zero-sum tasks
5479 still obama 's fault !
5480 she would be in girl prison and everyone knows girls ca n't rape
5481 yes , joe is a derp .
5482 cognitive dissonance ?
5483 all we need to do is further privatize education and the free market will sort all of our problems out .
5484 but remember ... gay marriage is about love , not a cheap money grab .
5485 oh china
5486 is n't that what us magazine and cosmo are for ?
5487 john roberts that fucking benedict arnold traitor son of a bitch
5488 this is ridiculous - anyone even remotely familiar with religious dealings knows the loch ness monster is just a remnant of aleister crowley 's work at loch ness .
5489 definitely front page material
5490 if this can be proven , i wonder how many subsequent convictions just became nullified .
5491 far worse than this , is the fact that fox has tricked people into thinking it is a news organization .
5492 the callousness , hatred , and lack of empathy among american workers for others in their class is sickening and saddening .
5493 jesus would have scolded her too !
5494 'this is just good business '
5495 yes , dems respect for bills that have `` already been passed by congress '' on guns is paramount .
5496 never trust people that have the ability to pass laws that affect you and not them .
5497 yeah but it rains a bunch so do n't come here it 's not as good as people keeping telling you , i 'm sure these savings will pass too you can visit but you totally do n't want to live in this paradise nope nope nope .
5498 and the robert 's court could very well say yes .
5499 just another example of obama 's respect for the rule of law .
5500 those southern baptists exemplify the life of jesus so well , do n't you think ?
5501 he was the most qualified candidate with 4 years of mayoral experience .
5502 and download to a database the police dont have access to .
5503 just like jesus would do !
5504 til there are jobs which offer more than 10 dollars an hour
5505 file criminal charges and bust up both companies into little pieces .
5506 i ca n't see how this will be abused .
5507 i would say what i really feel about jim demint but i like being able to fly on airplanes .
5508 in my opinion you could make the argument this is even a whole lot of racist creep here .
5509 i wonder what party he belongs to ?
5510 1-3 people in portland oregon have been transgender for at least 3weeks .
5511 that ought to stop all the bullet conspiracy theories .
5512 because all the black people duh !
5513 like `` hope '' they get over being a bunch of crazy bastards ?
5514 yeah , public accountability is a headache our elected officials should n't have to deal with .
5515 `` if we legalize marijuana we need to find another way to crowd our for-profit-prisons '' ~ barry
5516 but le mitt would have been worse
5517 christ , does he have no shame at all ?
5518 how dare you conservatives , hillary is a fucking saint !
5519 but but but , both parties the saaaame !
5520 if obama did n't hate white people then he would have the decency to be white himself !
5521 exposing wrong doing by the government is terrible !
5522 yeah , romney would have done so much better ....
5523 obama got a blow job from an intern ?
5524 of course , the ever hungry american , land of the highest rate of being underweight due to lack of food .
5525 what a great group of people , nice christians .
5526 protected and served .
5527 thanks for the laugh .
5528 that outreach is going great !
5529 he 's not even pretending gun control is about crime or public safety anymore .
5530 we can all stop with the nsa spied on _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , they spy on the planet .
5531 and he taught constitutional law ?
5532 i 'm sure obama will reschedule it any day now !
5533 who didnt already know this needs to travel .
5534 more like white people are better at not getting caught
5535 no doubt our elected representatives will do what 's in our best interest , not simply acting out the will of the highest bidder
5536 the evangelicals/fundamentalists are evidently having a contest to see who can say the most over-the-top pronouncement about kristianity without ever having to cite the bible or anything else .
5537 how shocking
5538 but you can carry a gun in the us of a so it all balances out in the end .
5539 ebola is god 's punishment on texas for giving human rights to mexicans and wimmen .... wait ... that 's not right
5540 time to start gerrymandering !
5541 it 's the house nonsense committee .
5542 since reagan it has been established that the master can order his slaves to vote the way he wants .
5543 they do n't want certain people to vote .
5544 no no , that was in the public 's interest .
5545 plus a pony for every child .
5546 more like `` how many people must be killed before our militarized government does n't allow the press to report on these events any more '' .
5547 republicans have a huge supporter in this effort , young people and minorities , who tend not to vote in midterms even when republicans are n't trying to block them .
5548 i 'm waiting for the gop to offer money to people not to vote
5549 by the time the cancer clusters show up , will the statute of limitations have run out on prosecuting the guilty ?
5550 to whom ?
5551 damn liberal reality !
5552 you mean the guys you did a photo-op with recently john ?
5553 what is it with texas and putting the mentally handicapped into the governorship ?
5554 it 's nice to to see the gop focusing on the * real * problems facing america
5555 sounds like 38 % of republicans are god damned rino 's !
5556 just like jesus intended
5557 oh yes , this seems to be real kosher , because nobody ever sabotaged another 's political career or travel plans to conveniently get them out of the running .
5558 yeah , but how many more people will go to * hell * ?
5559 worked for polio !
5560 or equally unstable as the case may be .
5561 i 'll take the job .
5562 i guess this means all other problems have been solved .
5563 oh texas ... next time you chastise anyone else we 'll all just laugh at you .
5564 the gift that keeps on giving .
5565 democrats angered again by themselves not doing the same thing better than the enemy .
5566 `` free press '' in the us is an illusion .
5567 so basically we should just privatize everything and make it a for profit business ?
5568 how about the marinara industry
5569 are you trying to tell me more people smoke weed than people watch football ? astonishing .
5570 is america ready for a floridian president ?
5571 the miracle of small government .
5572 well , the fed just spent their last 990 million to manipulate the markets monday so maybe we 'll see actual price discovery in the near future .
5573 gee i do n't know are they diebold machines ?
5574 liberals do frequently vote to cut programs to help the disenfranchised
5575 i 'm pretty sure the overwhelming majority of violent criminals do n't vote -- since , ya know , it 's illegal fuck head , but also because violent criminal generally do n't take much interest in government .
5576 because conservatives are always the victims .
5577 damn all those babies born to into poverty are going to love causing a ruckus with all these guns !
5578 obviously this person was n't mentally ill ; while all those white guys shooting up churches , schools , universities , theatres , black protesters were all obviously mentally ill and not normal
5579 but racism ended in 1964
5580 duh ?
5581 why risk it ?
5582 yes yes , join the dark side !
5583 i do n't like that either .
5584 we are supposed to pretend this stunt is about the veterans instead of another debate dodge .
5585 he 's not racist enough or enough of a religious zealot to get the gop nod .
5586 that 's his base , the fringe who think that it 's ok for dozens of people to get mowed down by mass shooters because 2nd amendment - but an embryo is worth killing over .
5587 oh yea , maybe this will stump him .
5588 he 's a fascist in training ?
5589 mathematics has a liberal bias .
5590 this is so next time obama leaves the country trump wo n't let him back in .
5591 his narcissistic insanity should be disqualifying him serving as president .
5592 do n't worry .. he 's a brilliant negotiator , he can work well with everyone
5593 obama 's gon na take our guns ... but for real this time
5594 `` this is exhibit a in the mainstream media 's `` liberal bias . ' ''
5595 it 's good they 're finally catching a break
5596 because no one hates * liberty * more than * liberals *
5597 can we keep him in office ?
5598 no shit .
5599 it 's cause those 57 % were done by muslims
5600 ya , and the washington examiner is a newspaper .
5601 no no no no , terrorist are brown
5602 whenever i hear this guys name , all i can think of is when he awkward drank some water on live tv .
5603 in other words `` trump tells the truth ! ''
5604 cool , now can we stop thinking that it 's only 1 political party that 's the problem ?
5605 all you democrat voting retards are getting played like a fucking fiddle .
5606 any more debates and these morons will be literally flinging feces at each other .
5607 jesus christ this guy is a flipping jagaloon .
5608 so stop worrying about it , go buy a few guns , be happy .
5609 more trickle on economics ?
5610 just in time for the debate so they can lead every question with `` bernie your losing by 33 points ... what is your thoughts on ... ''
5611 well , then we should ban all cars , clearly !
5612 is there a chance that sanders and trump run independent ?
5613 `` why should they pay more , they 'worked ' hard for their money ! ''
5614 one wasted post from you
5615 did he make sure to wipe the server ?
5616 that 'll show 'em !
5617 maybe she fainted again .
5618 more terrifying than the stuff putin is responsible for ?
5619 oh another ppp poll , should be worth looking at .
5620 crooks have rights too and having lobbyists is a right .
5621 this is even worse than when mitt romney tried to look hispanic with his orange makeup
5622 god gave man dominion over the earth to fuck it up as he sees fit .
5623 so proud of my home state .
5624 i doubt they 're nine cause white supremacists tend to be much older than that , in their teens at least .
5625 that 'll show shillary for being ahead of sanders !
5626 the tea party types would give him the electric chair .
5627 the gop reminds me of enron except that trump is only a cartoon backwoods character too dumb to understand any of it still imagining he is the smartest guy in the room the day before the end comes and trying to sell his stock to fools .
5628 there 's a plum ambassadorship at stake here !
5629 if bernie is elected big business and all the job with it are going to flee america , he will destroy the economy .
5630 because the * last * thing we need right now is alternatives to fossil fuels .
5631 inb4 2016 is the `` warmest '' on record .
5632 clearly , another example of the progressive agenda hurting small businesses .
5633 civil war 2 is here now ?
5634 you mean when you see bernie
5635 dumpster should declare war on both and take their oil !
5636 i feel safer already
5637 well reasoned , rational thing to say .
5638 umm it 's been that way forever .
5639 `` if you like your doctor you can keep him '' ?
5640 one of the better nominees tbh .
5641 part of the genius masterplan to improve the american export market .
5642 but hey hillary was going to start ww3
5643 do n't worry , it 's just a scrap of paper anyways
5644 all hail president bannon !
5645 but at least i can keep my guns !
5646 lyin ' ted ?
5647 not a trump supporter , but i imagine they will say that it 's not corrupt ; the democrats are being crybabies and are trying to undermine trump 's administration , so this is the only way to get around it
5648 this is what democracy looks like
5649 but remember guys , both parties are exactly the same !
5650 would their twitter accounts fall under foia ?
5651 aaannnnd his dementia has taken us back to the 1980s apparently .
5652 it wouldnt surprise me if putin put trump in office just to have a president be docile towards him while he conquers .
5653 if by `` overhaul '' you mean `` dismantle . ''
5654 that 's like saying good on ( random person ) for de-armenianing the armenian genocide .
5655 watch the exxon stock explode in the next months .
5656 please , god , let this be the last we hear of him .
5657 look at what he has done for alabama .
5658 yup , seems like the greatest job creator god ever created has been more preoccupied with firing everyone in sight .
5659 this ca n't possibly have anything to do with our new sos being the recent ceo of a major drilling company , can it ?
5660 if trump and his cronies have their way , the national debt will most likely balloon .
5661 stop the fucking drug war then you fuck
5662 she said she wanted to impose a no-fly zone on syria , how do you not see how that would result in a war like it did in libya ?
5663 sure , minority president donald , poke the bear why do n't you .
5664 b ... b .. but hilary and benghazi !
5665 i 'm sure congress will have as many investigations as they did over benghazzi .
5666 this does n't fit your narrative .
5667 do n't you know that terrorism is only terrorism when it happens to white people .
5668 could the reporter 's publication sue on the basis of freedom of the press ?
5669 what an embarrassment .
5670 they do n't care what the pope says .
5671 like he did a great job with ca
5672 that 's why i only watch fox news !
5673 life comes at ya quick
5674 * * failing ny times
5675 because imagine how hilarious the liberal reactions will be when the entire country is destroyed kekekekek
5676 the presidency .
5677 wow this is surprising .
5678 `` see , i told you we needed to move more money from education to defense . ''
5679 i wonder if he 'll take questions from the screens today , that are in no way pre-planned questions
5680 what could go wrong ?
5681 but most americans voted for trump !
5682 yeah , but that does n't account for the -20 point obama nomination hit that any candidate has to overcome first .
5683 that 's what i thought !
5684 i 'm sure he will come into meetings with a complete understanding of what is to be discussed fully informed on the issues , just so prepared
5685 this wo n't end badly
5686 how dare that reporter be mexican and a legal citizen !
5687 we should just install gun vending machines throughout the nation .
5688 why would we want unpolluted streams
5689 but dems wo n't give this issue up !
5690 it would make it even more illegal , so they would n't do it , obviously .
5691 it was n't a jew persecution because hitler did n't kill * * all * * jews .
5692 sexism
5693 call all of these senators immediately !
5694 i think the strategy is to throw so much shit around that the public and media are n't able to give enough attention to any of it .
5695 majority of the participants in this survey are illegal mexicans and muslim terrorists , plus statistics is a hoax by the chinese to undermine our dear leader .
5696 that 's illegal as fuck and grounds for impeachment .
5697 we need a car magnet ribbon .
5698 i hope `` bernie or bust '' feels * really * good about themselves .
5699 just looking out for those forgotten people !
5700 we 've all been there
5701 they 'd be wrong
5702 a credible source is one which supports my view point , duh
5703 pro-life !
5704 this is going to be great for the poor and middle class !
5705 holy shit , i never expected this .
5706 that seems like a perfectly stable and rational thing to do
5707 i am sure trump was civil and diplomatic .
5708 but really , do presidents need to be there ?
5709 we all know how wrong the polls can be !
5710 yeah , no shit .
5711 that .... picture is horrifying .
5712 everything they do is stupid , we 've elected an idiot
5713 not surprised they 're disappearing when they 're all hanging around american schools .
5714 but i thought the rest of the world did n't respect us under obama !
5715 clinton base so not really surprising .
5716 a hoax perpetuated by people so powerful and diabolical that they could hire actors to fill an entire town for years and years , but so inept that they rehired actors from other crises and arranged for port-a-potties ahead of time .
5717 not if devos has anything to say about it .
5718 how are trump voters spinning this one ?
5719 nah , did you see the size of his inauguration crowds ?
5720 after only 2 weeks trump only needs 87 to catch up .
5721 if by strong start he means strong start towards destroying the separation of powers , then yes he has gotten off to a strong start .
5722 found the trumpster
5723 til that the nra is part of the trump administration .
5724 cuckservative confirmed
5725 i wonder how bushes presidency would have been if it wasnt for 9/11 and the iraq war .
5726 hmm i did n't know that was the definition of a caliphate .
5727 regulations are for pussies .
5728 this will make it easier for poor people to get out and vote .
5729 making america great !
5730 you mean when the brave texas governor mobilized the texas guard and we narrowly averted obama 's attempted coup ?
5731 anything to get him out of working on something important , says bannon .
5732 clearly a terrorist trying to destroy america !
5733 * autistic screeching
5734 had to change out his testosterone patch and adult diaper .
5735 but , emails .
5736 i mean if putin himself says he did n't kill those guys , how can we really know who did ?
5737 at least it 's not as worse as hilary 's email scandal
5738 mmmmm ... what she said was that her mom had a choice and that it was wonderful she chose to have her .
5739 at least we 're getting those coal jobs back in west virginia .
5740 i 'm sure this will be coherent and rational .
5741 anti-american , but very pro-puppet .
5742 probably , but those briefings are really long and boring , so idk enough to confirm our deny this .
5743 donald trump is insane and needs to be impeached .
5744 neat .
5745 so , less tax money will go for something people do n't need .
5746 you ca n't prove that the media did n't cover up a terrorist attack !
5747 cause goldman sachs is the people 's bank , right ?
5748 this was clearly the work of barack obama .
5749 and if the press never reports on this list then it is proof that the media is covering this up .
5750 wow hes getting great respect from enemies and friends !
5751 they can take whatever side they please when they start paying taxes .
5752 more gaslighting from the dumpster admin .
5753 there needs to be something stronger than putting it on the front page !
5754 til not wanting creationism in the education system is a `` war on religion . ''
5755 obviously the bbc is fake news ...
5756 glad she 's in charge of education
5757 that headline is complete shit because it implies that there were any unreported terror attacks on the list do n't give him a inch
5758 keep it up , lib , you 're going to make 2020 easy for us .
5759 good , let him spend the rest of his presidency golfing .
5760 what we really need is a church of america with the donald as its infallible spiritual leader .
5761 bruh i 'd take 16 years of kanye over what we 're getting right now .
5762 great news for public education !
5763 fuck .
5764 democracy works !
5765 eh , who cares about the cannon fodder , its the war profiteers who really matter
5766 your title is bad and you should feel bad .
5767 `` i like immigration but it needs to be done legally '' * changes the definition of what `` legally '' means *
5768 does this factor in the fact that californians and new yorkers are only 3/5 of a person ?
5769 `` we had to destroy the judicial branch in order to save it ''
5770 `` wrong , that 's a horse poll , fakenews ''
5771 that 's a bad look marco
5772 comrade trump will not tolerate unwanted opinions .
5773 terrorist .
5774 he wants to help the poor like the bible says , how misguided of him !
5775 well if morning joe did n't cover them then how could he be expected to tweet about them ?
5776 but , guys , he 's only taking a salary of $ 1 from the office .
5777 wish i was more surprised ...
5778 hey - the founding fathers did not specify facebook or twitter in the constitution so its fair game
5779 i feel like , every time i see another headline about this , i get just a little bit angrier .
5780 how is mexico planning on paying for it btw ?
5781 soon it will be a common belief that the media covers up terrorist attacks and lies about crime rates because of liberal political correctness .
5782 never forget .
5783 but forcing sharia law is bad , amirite ?
5784 hey let 's let our country get covered in smog and our rivers get polluted .
5785 wow , i ca n't believe i ever voted for that guy .
5786 a large gathering of people resulted in a lot of trash , i guess that completely invalidates everything they were protesting for .
5787 ivanka might have better luck with a pop up in rural america .
5788 he clearly hates america .
5789 open up them libel laws !
5790 i guess this is even more proof that his family has nothing to do with his influence as president .
5791 the problem is that the rules are whatever the majority wants them to be .
5792 as someone who works in tourism , thanks for all the maga .
5793 i 'm here to say they wo n't be .
5794 and spicer is an outstanding press secretary
5795 guess i know where i 'm going to buy my new suits this weekend .
5796 well , he 's finally utilizing @ potus .
5797 and they are not the first state to do this , welcome to the club .
5798 vault 7
5799 so its between making a buck or giving a fuck , we all know where the gop stands .
5800 sounds more like hillary
5801 awww poor baby
5802 please call him a `` fake pope '' ... please
5803 `` lindsay graham is one of the good republicans , he 's been criticizing trump ! ''
5804 yes , because his legitimacy was n't in question until just recently .
5805 of all the possible ethics violations this administration could commit , this is the least of them
5806 i 'm sure sessions will get right on that .
5807 it was n't about buying the fucking country you fucking douchebag .
5808 the trump crime family will also be targeted ?
5809 priority landing based on how much you pay ... what could go wrong ?
5810 `` i 've never shot a gun before , but let me tell you why they 're shit ! ''
5811 george soros for president
5812 trump delivering on his promise to get the best and brightest .
5813 but , it 's those muslims we need to worry about .
5814 uh huh , all of a sudden they like obamacare huh ?
5815 well if obama had reached across .
5816 this is a shocking development
5817 what a success !
5818 `` so-called judge '' stands up for the rule of law .
5819 uh oh , ethics committee is going to overstep their bounds again .
5820 any time now guys !
5821 trumps comments put judges security at risk , its ironic how the people menacing judges lives want a ban on muslim because they are dangerous .
5822 your employees can have there visas back as soon as the complete hl3 .
5823 that does n't mean much , i have evidence that you are secretly a monkey with a computer .
5824 how could anyone pretend to hate ivanka trump .
5825 that 's rich coming from queen 0-2 herself .
5826 the football & amp ; the biscuit
5827 the true threat to america
5828 another poll ?
5829 dear congress - do your job and protect the republic from this clueless petty nutbag .
5830 he 's going to get a cramp in his grabbin ' hand .
5831 we used to be a place where other countries could point to as an example but it seems like so many have have left us in the dust .
5832 i like how the free market is triggering conservatives now .
5833 is there anything left of the state department ?
5834 surely those responsible for the incredibly thorough benghazi ~~withhunt~~ investigation are only moments away from beginning an equally thorough investigation into this matter , though !
5835 the fuck kinda bondage fantasy thumbnail is that shit
5836 i wonder why there 's no whining about a potus using so many eo 's ... i wonder what 's different ?
5837 wow , george soros is busy !
5838 it 's his way of continuing to show everyone who calls the shots .
5839 almost like they realize they 're doing shameful things .
5840 how many years did they rail on clinton about benghazi yet they pull pure fiction out of the air ?
5841 i 'm glad that trump is not divisive like barack obama .
5842 glad he has his priorities straight and tackling the real issues first
5843 it 's cool because you do n't see those bodies piling up .
5844 if enough information in the dossier is confirmed to toss trump out of office , i will name my first-born child dossier .
5845 im sure you have plenty of other ways to dishonor your mormon heritage .
5846 eight years is harsh , but then again she did vote republican .
5847 one way he saved money in the past was to refuse to pay contractors .
5848 he could use a vacation from all the golfing
5849 since was birth control something that the government had to pay for ?
5850 are they tired of all the winning yet ?
5851 `` hand over all clothing and gold emojis before entering the detainment showers . ''
5852 totally no appearance of impropriety .
5853 he 's surely a student of history
5854 ... the retardation .. it burns
5855 gop - you are a disgrace for allowing this to continue .
5856 you guyz just havent given him a chance
5857 just think of the fantastic decisions he has to come !
5858 kansas .
5859 wtf i hate women now
5860 but he wrote a strongly worded email !
5861 but he held up a flag !
5862 this is sure to go well .
5863 i 'm sure that flynn simply pardoned himself because he was n't capable of being part of an administration winning so much on a daily basis .
5864 pretty fucking bad timing for this headline !
5865 how kind of the kremlin .
5866 he wants to investigate the fbi for catching flynn .
5867 flynn is probably on the phone with russia * right now * telling them everything he learned in the last month .
5868 there has never been more slime in the swamp than what trump brought to it .
5869 maybe putin sees his trumpuppet conspiracy beginning to unravel , and this is part of his `` plan b . ''
5870 do n't worry guys , jason chaffetz is on it .
5871 i expect an immediate , strong reaction from chaffetz on the oversight committee .
5872 coulda been anyone
5873 why would any of these red blooded americans want to go to that socialist hell hole up north ?
5874 oh well , i 'm sure if it 's chaffetz himself the investigation will be thorough and unrelenting .
5875 alternative fact ; she will be promoted for being so gosh darn amazing at her job !
5876 you 're all just upset you have no one to scorn or spit at as much .
5877 so much winning !
5878 palestinians wo n't mind at all
5879 the country has a means of shutting it down if it 's treason
5880 when miller claimed that the white house has presented `` enormous evidence '' of voter fraud such as multi-state registration , my first thought was : `` your evidence is your own family and cabinet , right ? ''
5881 well , obviously
5882 this is clearly the real scandal .
5883 the obama era database of some 750k daca `` dreamers '' has now become a shopping list for administration 45
5884 `` emphatically denied that he was in contact with russians known to us intelligence '' where did i hear that before ... totally not from flyn , right ?
5885 maybe trump can point to this and say `` see russia say it did n't happen , ignore our intelligence agencies , only russia would be honest . ''
5886 speaking of that , when is as-seen-on-tv going to issue toilet paper with trump on it ?
5887 but , like , what about russia ?
5888 i wonder if glenn beck has any reason to shit on obama and iran ... hmmmmmmmmm
5889 so he 's got like 6 months tops to get this done
5890 the best way to attack trump is say something/anything negative about him .
5891 obviously he 's not a true patriot republican^tm
5892 i believe the correct term is `` alternative fact '' .
5893 lets fully legalize suppressors next !
5894 a , a totally unbiased question from `` town hall ''
5895 also epa , doe , usda , darpa ....
5896 so are they trying to paint cnn as the left 's fox , without the bimbos and the insane commentators ?
5897 `` but the emails ! ''
5898 `` this is a direct attack on the presidentoftheunitedstatesrabababreeeeeeeeeeee '' -trump & amp ; co
5899 `` mr ~~burns~~ trump , your ~~candidacy~~ presidency seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train , why are you so popular '' ?
5900 having your government being taken over by a psychotic republican coup is never fun .
5901 2020 , perfect vision !
5902 dear leader needs a `` love me '' rally to pick up his spirits .
5903 i believe this is what they call fake news
5904 how could this not be good for american people ?
5905 well considering alabama is so well renowned for it 's education , this comes as no surprise .
5906 please release anything just distract from this russia thing !
5907 depends if you like your candidates racist and orange
5908 yeah , hillary was much worse on protecting classified info
5909 so while everyone is busy trying to make sense of mr trump , ukrainians ( and possibly some russians ) die because of putin .
5910 again ?
5911 nonsense , nothing ever happens to unpopular leaders in russia
5912 i bet he 's still all for russian hooker leaks .
5913 omg wtf
5914 are these the same polls that said hillary was a 93 % chance to win ?
5915 lol is that why he looks like such a dumbass up there ?
5916 so nordstrom dropping your daughters clothing line is a terrible thing , a russian spy shit operating in us waters is not good ?
5917 if there is anything the markets like its uncertainty , you are probably right .
5918 they should 've just sent it to april ryan and she could have arranged the meeting for trump
5919 cummings probably canceled the meeting because he was busy dodging bullets in the inner city where he lives .
5920 `` well oiled machine ! ''
5921 even easier for the millions of illegals to vote against trump .
5922 just trying to make it easier for all those freeloading illegal aliens to vote by giving them time off from the jobs they stole from us .
5923 yes , that 's the exact and only reason .
5924 well , they did n't pursue charges against hillary , so it makes sense .
5925 its a world wide conspiracy !
5926 maybe ivanka told him ... * '' it 's either cnn or holiday inn '' *
5927 finally , someone said it !
5928 hispanic , short hair , hoodie , young , male ... obviously a gang member .
5929 trump supporters response ?
5930 obviously it 's the media 's fault , it 's a bad eo , but it 's fake news
5931 remember when the free market took it upon themselves to clean up the cuyahoga river when it kept catching on fire ?
5932 but he 's not taking a wage
5933 they do n't ?
5934 but do n't worry , they 'll totally be entitled to due process .
5935 well , it is well known that all black people know one another .
5936 get them under oath on that .
5937 admits he is a useless liberal ... classic
5938 but the email server !
5939 i give him two months .
5940 because marijuana was nonexistent in idaho before it became legal in neighboring states .
5941 ca n't have a discussion of obama without bush
5942 remember when obama took everyone 's guns away ?
5943 `` * oh , but breitbart is great though ! ''
5944 what 's the problem , precedent has been set .
5945 we have nothing to fear but a free and unfettered press
5946 misleading title- not literal
5947 seems like a credible site
5948 the jackass episode with him is my favorite .
5949 but they 're experts , and experts ca n't be trusted .
5950 no proof he 's sold his stake in dapl either .
5951 perhaps we can crowd fund a membership to the club and elect a representative to vouch for the concerns of the american people .
5952 i 'm sure this will make schools safer
5953 for a million you get to pick one foreign policy move !
5954 hey but he is not taking the salary so it 's all good
5955 well , this proves once and for all that liberals secretly hate gays , and the whole gay marriage / gay rights thing is a total sham .
5956 violations of the emoluments clause .
5957 you 'd think with all the whining about elections recently that there would be a bigger push for reform
5958 well , she is part of the muslim brotherhood .
5959 fbi , the guys you can trust .
5960 what a mess , it was yuuge
5961 i am increasingly sure that russia has a ton of blackmail on a lot of the gop , including gay stuff .
5962 patriot who loves america .
5963 fake news .
5964 he 's been given plenty of time , so no .
5965 dude do n't ask us , ask him
5966 but clinton is really the pay-to-play person , glad we did n't elect her
5967 but remember folks cohen was never in prague or russia and has nothing to do with this .
5968 better impeach her !
5969 well you know he 's like a smart person
5970 who cares what these moronic `` journalists '' think about anything
5971 the crown prince of the `` alt right ''
5972 seems legit .
5973 president ~~donald trump~~ bannon is no longer the shortest-serving us president in history
5974 a little ironic if a conservative group cancels on him when they have been non-stop rage-flinging feces every time a librul university cancels on him .
5975 fake news
5976 they have a history of making them a speaker of the house already , though .
5977 are we sure it 's not from the increased morale caused by the trump presidency ?
5978 why do republicans oppress milo 's free speech ?
5979 lets make `` thanks trump '' a thing
5980 `` hypocrisy '' -- brought to you by donald trump -- - new perfume line
5981 intelligent comments in here so far
5982 the only explanation is that trump , devos , and the entire gop are lizard people from space that do n't need clean air and water to survive .
5983 what , cpac wo n't stand for free speech ?
5984 profits rule from the health 'industry ' , education 'industry ' , to the prison 'industry ' !
5985 oh look , the gop wants a small government by introducing fines against people who drive electric cars .
5986 ... at which point the bill will be dead on arrival .
5987 well it is his * winter white house *
5988 wtf other country in the entire world would even do this ?
5989 gop rep : can guarantee that many will lose insurance under gop plan
5990 he needs to protect his citizens and not worry because donald was referencing when he saw an article on sweden .
5991 he needs to shut up and lawyer up .
5992 for such a conspiracy theory to work , law enforcement also had to be in on it .
5993 surprising no one
5994 i will never forget when he said that at a debate and the crowd started laughing at him .
5995 man , gets mainstream exposure on bill maher friday , and out of breitbart by tuesday .... so sad
5996 oh yeah , this policy will totally stand up in court !
5997 yiannopoulos has not advocated pedophilia he was just ordering pizza using code words because media icons like him it is more acceptable to be shaggung 13 year olds than eating carbs
5998 i 'm sure her cigarette smoking , dinner wine drinking daddy will be horrified .
5999 but but but i was told that muslims were the real anti-semites !
6000 personal blog , not affiliated with a news site .
6001 the fuck is an `` assault weapon '' ?
6002 we have to take out iran to defend our freedom .
6003 we decide war via polls now ?
6004 untrue
6005 because polls are so reliable , but hey , this makes for a great headline ( and no i 'm not a trump fan in the least )
6006 report for not exact headline
6007 yea they prob are all still mad about her emails .
6008 * * conspiracy alex jones will not be silenced * *
6009 got his priorities straight , i 'll give him that .
6010 art of the deal
6011 but he held that rainbow flag !
6012 more pie in the sky rhetoric from the disaster in chief .
6013 of course they do .
6014 but its ok because trump has a beautiful family .
6015 that guy is a real maverick .
6016 because the way forward is the way back and coal is the way forward .
6017 no way
6018 kim jong un declares himself emperor of the world : more useless actions at 10 !
6019 hey , he 's bringing the country together with one common idea !
6020 can do !
6021 i take most polls with a grain of salt nowadays .
6022 who cares about the kids as long as the gop gets to score a few points at a minority group 's expense ?
6023 way to damn easy
6024 do n't worry , they 'll still be protected under existing laws
6025 another policy to help unify .
6026 tell me again , trump supporters , how trump was going to be so great for lgbt people .
6027 if only we had been warned he would do this before we elected him
6028 ca n't pony up ~ $ 150m for nea but will spend more than that just to secure the gaudy trump towers for the philistine-in-chief .
6029 obama 's shadow government is trying to take down our government !
6030 no , they have aca not obamacare
6031 has anyone found how that piece of shit cotton responded ?
6032 who needs competence when you have yesmen amirite
6033 money saved goes straight into billionaires ' pocket via tax cuts .
6034 because wall patrol is more important than paw patrol kid .
6035 just another coincidence i 'm sure
6036 i hope his golf game is better than his intelligence
6037 this is unsafe .
6038 i 'd vote for a rock .
6039 nothing suspicious here .
6040 if he 's actually visiting europe to discuss russian hacking ... that is veeeeeery interesting .
6041 of course and all americans ( 99 % ) will go broke because of this will he laughs his way to the bank .
6042 but , .... sanders supporters ca n't take over the party , because hillary won the primary and got way more votes than bernie .
6043 how can it be the truth if it 's fake news
6044 shocking
6045 typical liberal snowflake .
6046 but cohen said he never was in prague because he showed us the cover of his passport and denied he ever was in russia so therefore he has nothing to do with russia just like his boss .
6047 do n't trumpers like weed ?
6048 got ta pay for that wall somehow .
6049 i mean , what if someone smuggles a nuclear bomb into the country in a big shipment of pot ?
6050 thanks comey
6051 just as long as they do n't take away my aca , i am okay with that .
6052 yeah but they make up for it by not paying taxes
6053 literally phoning it in .
6054 yes , a plant is the real enemy we need to be focused on .
6055 as he attempted to talk through his call to abolish the epa , protesters screamed , `` your last term ! ''
6056 that certainly does n't set any dangerous precedents
6057 in times like this we must not worry because trump once held a rainbow flag .
6058 probably no one .
6059 i guess things changed a bit when celebrity president declared war on criticising him .
6060 `` brought down osama bin laden '' pics or it did n't happen .
6061 and the number of those scientists who study the environment for a living is ... ?
6062 maybe trump will solve their problems by saling all his crap ( and family ) at incredible savings with coupons to loyal party members
6063 it 's gon na be a looonnnnggg 4 years of this bull shit .
6064 the republican party has the best people
6065 that rat faced fuck chaffetz is a fucking coward .
6066 i look forward to qu'ran , torah , necronomicon , and other literacy classes to be offered alongside the bible-oriented classes .
6067 but mexican americans waving mexican flags are the real traitors !
6068 i love one party , right wing governments !
6069 jesus is going to come back soon anyway so nothing really matters .
6070 i feel like before 4 years is over , trump is going to have some sort of ridiculous , north korea-esque state news show that lists his daily accomplishments .
6071 the man is a coward .
6072 constantly lose to facts ; do n't allow fact checkers in room .
6073 wait , trump barred breitbart and infowars ?
6074 seriously , when is the federal government going to stop protecting its most marginalized citizens and start looking after rich white christians ?
6075 state sponsored media is fake news
6076 well , when you 're the belle of the ball , you can pretty much do what you want , right ?
6077 so when mexico allows people from other countries to enter the us illegally through mexico we just have to be okay with that ?
6078 will you stop spamming your fucking website
6079 ... aside from whatever fox news might have managed to make up , was there ever a poll that said otherwise ?
6080 but how will we win if we can chant the magic incantation ?
6081 why do i feel like i am at the beginning of `` in the garden of beasts '' more and more every day ?
6082 no it is not think of all those unemployed americans that can now move to the agricultural areas and work in the fields picking crops now that the illegals will all be gone .
6083 any words from trump ?
6084 i understand the decision but if the dnc fails to elect ellison on top of this decision it will look like 0 for 2 from the left side of the party 's viewpoint .
6085 shocking .
6086 what could possibly go wrong in having a profit incentive to locking people up ?
6087 glad he sounds like he 's approaching this with the impartiality it deserves
6088 well , if he ca n't be tough there , how is he gon na be tough on isis then ?
6089 as long as we are n't exaggerating .
6090 liberal medias at it again !
6091 because the reason for microsoft 's success is cheap labor , right
6092 one more company for redcaps to `` boycott '' , i guess .
6093 could you imagine the shit storm the republicans in congress and talking heads at fox news would be making if something like this had happened if hillary had been president ?
6094 from the man who put food before campaigning
6095 it likely was n't but the primary was
6096 join the military knowing you might die , what a surprise you die in a military operation , now everyone is losing their mind insert joker meme here .
6097 what 's the matter , you snowflakes ca n't handle the real america ?
6098 why talk when you can bomb ?
6099 i hope trump wo n't go off on him , but i would n't be surprised , given the fact that he 's a scumbag .
6100 they say that like it 's a bad thing
6101 finkle is einhorn , einhorn is finkle
6102 the main problem is , trump only represents a minority of the country and that minority does n't include indian-americans .
6103 that 's the sessions i know !
6104 as long as she is triggering snowflakes i 'll vote for her .
6105 short bus `` special . ''
6106 wonder how much soros is paying him ?
6107 because they 're not people
6108 we can just use the 12b surplus trump has already created
6109 what a waste of money .
6110 good thing that is going to be paid for by cuts elsewhere .
6111 how then , do weapons dealers and defense contractors that pay-to-play rob from the american taxpayer by selling violence to the globe ?
6112 but then his friends over at dyncorp wo n't make any money , and he wo n't make any money ... : - (
6113 by nuking them before the war even starts !
6114 support the troops fuck the politicians
6115 or anyone that 's ever had to make an appeal .
6116 they are looking at canada 's healthcare system one possible blue print .
6117 i 'm sure without those rules they would never betray their customers
6118 says the draft dodger
6119 lying ass bitch
6120 so conservative .
6121 honestly at this point this presidency seems more like a social experiment than anything else
6122 trump complains about `` rigged '' elections - and now he is actively seeking to rig them by suppressing the vote .
6123 i wonder which party he belongs to .
6124 this is a problem if you ca n't make your way into the 1 % .
6125 oh , this should go well .
6126 well from an administration that has never lied i am quite relieved
6127 is n't the donald * always * attacking the `` failing '' * new york times * and the clinton news network ?
6128 obamas shadow government .
6129 facts do n't matter to republicans .
6130 i still have n't gotten my check for the woman 's march .
6131 what a surprise
6132 but spiceboy said they recovered info that will save america and was totally worth the loss of a seal and aircraft and civilians .
6133 whats wrong with you people he does n't have to show his taxes now go ahead and file your taxes so you do n't get arrested so he can decide how to spend it .
6134 so a rational person would have asked themselves 'why are two muslims in bar ' , then shoot them .
6135 has n't obama been in the caribbean sipping pina coladas and kitesurfing with richard branson ?
6136 `` i did n't know bullets could travel that far ''
6137 funny because a lot of hbcu 's predate jim crow laws .
6138 why is betsy devos insane other than being in a political party that you do n't support ?
6139 ca n't wait til we end up like parts of gyna ( china ) where only certain cars can drive on certain days , and i 'm wearing a face mask to work because i ca n't breathe , awesome .
6140 what happened to states rights ?
6141 moonies ignoring the real story here - obama looks cool and casual no matter what he 's standing on .
6142 let 's play the blame game .
6143 you learn fast in the military that you can delegate authority but not responsibility .
6144 stay classy and honest like you 've always been !
6145 that 's because all those people who voted for him have jobs .
6146 it 's less than his number of electoral votes he got so obviously it does n't matter .
6147 ah yes .... the evil jews are claiming there are bomb threats and knocking over tombstones in a horrific conspiracy .... just like they built the concentration camps and gassed millions of themselves to get israel established .
6148 i love article with lots of assertions and no links to other materials or quotes from actual people .
6149 why not terrorism ?
6150 rush limbaugh 's xanga is not a reputable news source .
6151 is this sub really that fucking stupid ?
6152 i guess `` extreme vetting '' and `` everything will be america first '' now includes consulting with foreign countries on what they 'd prefer we do .
6153 finally , and their huge cache of hoarded ammunition they stockpiled for 8 years is ready !
6154 if it takes crazy people being able to buy guns to make america great again , then , by god , crazy people are going to be able to buy guns !
6155 it 's ok , we * * can read * * all by ourselves .
6156 yeah , that 's not a biased source at all .
6157 it 's not uncommon for a politician to put forth a bill that he knows has absolutely no chance of actually becoming a law , to be able to pander to his very specific demographic who actually might be interested in that bill becoming a law .
6158 [ citation needed ]
6159 i guess those evangelicals must have been without sin , casting the first stones and all .
6160 that 's the end of newsome as a useful politician .
6161 stupid idea is stupid .
6162 clearly you must be a terrorist for questioning this noble bill ... usa usa usa .
6163 as much of a big jerk obama is for all the corporate bailouts and refusing to stand up to the warfare culture and such , are n't you still glad that mccain is n't president ?
6164 is it wrong to lie ?
6165 i would like to downvote the us on this one .
6166 but ... but ... it 's evil socialism .
6167 this seems like such a slam dunk ... of course corporations are not people ... this has to be passed before the summer .
6168 it 's a good thing reddit is immune to propaganda !
6169 you put the punchline in the title !
6170 i 'm waiting for fox and o'reilly 's apology .
6171 sorry dog
6172 too bad obama ca n't do anything about the patriot act and the tsa !
6173 he 's doing the best he can with the navy seals he inherited from the previous administration
6174 sure it was n't just a donut vendor they saw ?
6175 because that money is put to much more efficient use after being confiscated by government and pissed down a rathole .
6176 texas shits on the separation of church and state clause of constitution every day , this is just another step in the wrong direction
6177 i do like the sweet sound of crickets .
6178 i 'm actually inclined to agree with him at this point .
6179 i am both shocked and saddened by this unpredictable turn of events .
6180 gee , i feel safer already .
6181 people should all be sheep and only vote for things that benefit them for the immediate future , fuck future generations .
6182 how does this shit keep getting on the front page , this shit is old
6183 i 'm surprised the medical waste company did file for tax exemption status under the guise of being a church and performing `` funerals '' for these poor deceased children .
6184 it 's god 's will
6185 who cares that people are happy right ?
6186 what a patriot .
6187 til the gop is a branch of government comparable to the potus .
6188 well , given the choice between a soundbite-happy , somewhat misguided candidate who thinks we should n't fight wars unless totally necessary , and a soundbite-happy tremendously misguided candidate who thinks going to war against a sovereign country who never attacked us is a worthwhile pursuit , i 'll take the former every time .
6189 it 's totally ok to steal peoples ' property if it 's for a library !
6190 breaking news : fox full of assholes .
6191 but as member of the nobility is n't this his right ?
6192 and how exactly is a man responsible for decisions he probably did n't make ?
6193 that 's a lot of condoms .
6194 kessler can be amazingly idiotic .
6195 oh , he 'll tell you it 's a good thing , but only if you live in massachusetts ... otherwise it 's liberal taxation .
6196 envy is one of the seven deadly sins .
6197 nothing gets by you , rush .
6198 i am shocked , just shocked .
6199 i really wish big government would stop trying to indoctrinate our children with knowledge and valuable real world/in demand skills .
6200 he 's going to have a beautifully healthy relationship with his daughter .
6201 i find that hard to believe .
6202 i certainly agree with this .
6203 only americans are crazy enough to think this is a bad thing .
6204 deregulate lemonade stands !
6205 is there an easy to read breakdown out there of what is specifically offsetting the cost of this ?
6206 raising the level of discourse yet again
6207 can we , the taxpayers send him a bill for the money it would cost for him to do this ?
6208 i do n't understand why they want their child to go to a christian school .
6209 * center
6210 he 's a republican , he just did that to avoid paying taxes on the $ 175,000 .
6211 he 's going to be a great foreign diplomat when he grows up .
6212 so do we then `` liberate '' north carolina under the pretext of humanitarian aid ?
6213 obviously the jobless should just join the army , if they 're unqualified to become ~~mercenaries~~ contractors .
6214 it got pepper-sprayed
6215 he did such a good job helping to convince people to vote for newt gingrich , how could he fail ?
6216 to be fair these people do n't deserve anything , it 's really their fault for moving in to exxon 's area of operations before exxon got there .
6217 she ruined yahoo her alone did that sure its going to make money short term pumping up fake clicks by chinese firms done over-sea 's which drives up the stock price but the value- of yahoo as a service has went way down i used to use yahoo every-day i just use it to check email now
6218 walmart may pay their employees in pennies in order to force them to open a walmart bank account .
6219 good , as an economic refugee from california i can tell you that it is fucking expensive out there .
6220 this is why i can honestly say barack obama has done more damage to america than al qaeda ever could .
6221 that 's not what the agreement says - read this one before you pass it obama .
6222 ugh ... this title is just bad .
6223 boy i 'm glad to see they are saving money by limiting how many fax machines the dod can have !
6224 i thought this was common knowledge , is n't it called the `` sociological pyramid of needs '' or something like that ?
6225 not * the onion * .
6226 omegas bro , they 've got them
6227 well , it 's good for everyone that matters , right ?
6228 surprise !
6229 seeing as this was said on fox news i 'm not surprised in the least .
6230 i do n't think that instituting mandatory background checks qualifies as `` overreaching '' .
6231 oops , but i have nothing to hide
6232 in other news , water is wet , the sky is blue , and michelle bachmann is a gerrymandering bitch .
6233 silly rabbit welfare is for the rich .
6234 but the percentage of idiots seems to be represented quite accurately .
6235 perhaps ?
6236 seems like this was all a grand plan to me .
6237 and if i had destroyed evidence of fraud i 'd got to jail for a large chunk of my life .
6238 i am going out on a limb here and say that they will punish as many people responsible for this as they punished people responsible for the 2008 crash .
6239 surely obama will do something about this .
6240 why do n't the just remove math while they 're at it .
6241 there 's more profit in killing thousands of innocents !
6242 sure if hawaii is a state why not canada ?
6243 no chance the birthers will allow a guy born in canada to run .. not gon na happen .
6244 yeah , but howard dean screamed !
6245 yay , now something will get done on capitol hill !
6246 there is still a divided government .
6247 you do realize that there are people who are pro choice , and pro marijuana legalization and still tend to lean to the republican party , right ... ?
6248 fuck yeah i love this city !
6249 a new `` fact '' is now firmly established in alaska .
6250 student loan debt passed $ 1.2 * * t * * rillion in us
6251 you misspelled `` job creators ''
6252 but a small minority of the population constituted a landslide , and a clear mandate .
6253 the solution is obviously tax cuts and relaxed environmental regulations .
6254 i am sure the ark encounter will fix the budget with all the billions of cash it will bring into the state .
6255 why should they be expected to pay it back ?
6256 now if we had a real `` free market '' -- -- -- -- this would be about a $ 5 an hour job .
6257 son obviously has superior genetics .
6258 the first republican fail of the new congress .
6259 i miss the days before obamacare , when costs rose at a reasonable rate .
6260 snooping sounds like snoopy so its easier to slip it past the public .
6261 i do n't know * who * to believe anymore !
6262 i wish i could afford a lobbyist .
6263 i did n't know watergate happened in 2000 !
6264 that 's why they voted republican .
6265 i think we could probably get a 100 to 0 vote against , hey senator did we mention the pipeline was running right over your property ?
6266 yes , because school lunches for years have been the stuff of gourmands !
6267 but do n't worry this will never happen if we go back to the gold standard for our money !
6268 the classic expediency ploy that comes ( came ) back to bite you big time .
6269 after being so militantly outspoken on this issue for 26 straight months , i 'm sure fox news will take a long hard look at their journalistic vetting process and really get back to fundamentals on reporting .
6270 let 's be realistic ... this probably is n't going to happen
6271 clearly he should have cosplayed as a white cliven bundy supporter .
6272 that 's why nothing is getting done !
6273 because it would cost the department more to deal with a lawsuit etc .
6274 he was just fighting tyranny .
6275 yeah , but they really stuck it to those lazy welfare people !
6276 i 'm sure they will find time to vote against `` obamacare '' and fund another `` special hearing '' on benghazi .
6277 let 's work on guaranteeing the rights it already asserts , and * then * worry about `` improving '' it !
6278 now that 's some politicians serving the public !
6279 yes , exactly what our nation needs to adjust the economic inequality , security and health issues .
6280 even if they do uncover misbehavior , intelligence services influencing internal politics are a majorly bad thing .
6281 it 's not much of a surprise , the right wing media and politicians seem to spend the majority of their time whipping up anger and fear .
6282 well , you know , all those brown people do look alike ...
6283 the only acceptable racism , is reverse racism .
6284 is he going to make the background check system freely available to the public that he 's trying to fuck , since he wants more background checks ?
6285 this is related to oregon how ?
6286 just admit that entire amendment was created to allow slave holders to form `` militias '' to keep those `` happy to be enslaved '' from revolting .
6287 will he break up fannie mae ?
6288 inb4 playing the woman card
6289 as history has shown , prohibition always works .
6290 oh well i 'll definitely be swayed by bill because who can you trust more for the truth than the spouse of the person running ?
6291 i thought the economy was awesome because obama saved it
6292 omg how exciting i 'm sure this will turn out differently than the last 60-something attempts at repealing the affordable care act !
6293 husband decides threesome sounds like a great idea , takes request to his wife .
6294 delete this !
6295 so it begins .
6296 yet this has nothing to do with islam .... i think that guy forgot his
6297 how many people reading this bank at wells fargo , citibank , usbank or any other major bank in the us , then think it is the government 's job to make everything fair regarding these banks ?
6298 i agree with this but it will never get passed .
6299 are people ever going to recognize that much more takes place at planned parenthood than just abortions ?
6300 omg i wonder who he would 've endorsed !
6301 right-wingers aint terrorists- theys patriots !
6302 maybe they could go back and look at all the legislation they 've passed to help working families over the last 3 decades to get ideas ?
6303 i think that universities should also handle murder cases .
6304 this conclusion seems dubious .
6305 she was most likely joking .
6306 someone should tell her that trump ca n't deport people .
6307 is this expected or should i be surprised trump did n't get the nod ?
6308 i thought hillary was against stand your ground .
6309 did they poll the employees and subscribers first ?
6310 sending your kid out there to spout your lies is always a great idea !
6311 a couple congressional election cycles after he declares voting day a national holiday will quickly get him a congress in line with his policies .
6312 enjoy your down votes , terrorist !
6313 i bet he is wishing he had been slightly less of a prick to his fellow senators right about now .
6314 gives me the feels i have n't felt since ... well barack obama first ran for president .
6315 the toughest part of that sentence , is `` hurt their bottom line '' the economy is complicated ... vote bernie
6316 e pluribus unim
6317 he only seems to be attracting them .
6318 tweet it donnie and it 'll be true
6319 they 'll all go to war , stop lying to yourself .
6320 somebody kill me already ... the circlejerk is too much !
6321 yes , they 're just shoving those pills into people 's mouths .
6322 because ceos hire better lawyers , duh .
6323 small price to pay to not be weirded out by people different than you , right tennessee ?
6324 clearly he 's in her pocket .
6325 well gun owners do n't pay the costs of what their gun ownership costs the rest of us in the medical realm , why would they be held accountable for their actions in the criminal realm ?
6326 at gunpoint i assume ?
6327 yuge .
6328 i like cruz , but i do not believe he qualifies as 'natural born '' .
6329 sue them on what grounds ?
6330 ted cruz 's very bad , no good , rotten day .
6331 i saw trumps face , he seemed really excited to have her support .
6332 florida , the bastion of logic as far as states go .
6333 ted cruz for sociopathic hall-monitor '16 !
6334 the gop is totally crazy and incompetent ... except when they have a conspiracy to determine the outcome of the democratic nomination .
6335 well whatever he 's doing ai n't working , bernie continues to grow his lead in nh
6336 thanks , i 've been waiting for the financial industry to weigh in before making up my mind , because they have my best interests at heart .
6337 garfunkel and oats would have been better .
6338 the republican legislators probably want instructions on how to poison people in their own states .
6339 diplomatic prowess right there
6340 oh sweet jesus ... if chomsky is donating to sanders , he 's even more of a nutjob than i first though .
6341 breaking news : bernie sanders supports child abuse and is against video games !
6342 depends on what tier of the justice system end sup going after her .
6343 nah see , it 's cool because planned parenthood totally is n't entrenched in the dem establishment .
6344 which implies that she knew what they were doing and when they did n't stop she did n't warn anyone of what they were doing .
6345 at first i read that as `` bernie sanders attacks 2,000 '' and imagined bernie going berserk on a crowd of people .
6346 he sure has been effective for the last 30 years .
6347 sexist pig was just too lazy to do all the talking , classic male white cis privilage
6348 if we take the women billary has personally touched as any indication : -/
6349 hey we all know the way to create jobs is through tax breaks to the rich.job creators who will in turn give us high paying jobs .
6350 obama vaguely spoke ill of the chosen one ... he must be a republican ... burn him !
6351 absolutely nothing to see here .
6352 rand paul and would vote for him in a wide variety of flavors from all the other candidates running .
6353 my wife is a woman and she is frequently surprised .
6354 they 're getting desperate .
6355 i 'm sure they will debate the fiscal and health aspects as well as not ignore the overwhelming facts learned by other states attempting the same thing and will in no way blindly follow partisan rhetoric
6356 that ought to keep guns out of the hands of the bro- er , poor people !
6357 nice transparency there guys , that 'll show the public you can be trusted .
6358 because that 's what hillary clinton is known for , her deep christian faith .
6359 bernie sanders to cosponsor free free stuff to the lazy and unmotivated
6360 she 'll * backwards-evolve * ( or regress ) .
6361 why has n't this bitch been arrested yet ?
6362 title is definitely the lead , that really sums it up well .
6363 while we 're at it , let 's also teach men not to rape , educate the world how only white people can be racist , arrest all members of the patriarchy , and create federal safe spaces for women and otherkin .
6364 but he 's unelectable and does n't stand a chance , that 's why he is considered a major enough candidate to warrant protection , clearly !
6365 if vox says it , it must be true .
6366 but but ... bernie says he does n't have a super pac ?
6367 but he 's an old white man !
6368 itt : bunches of bernie fanbois is that refuse to hear both sides to the coin .
6369 party over people
6370 that 's yet another ringing endorsement in the credibility department .
6371 if it 's white nationalists are they still allowed to investigate ?
6372 what a despicable human being .
6373 shocked !
6374 if only someone would stand up for white people for once .
6375 but it 's unfair to compare trump to hitler because some people use hyperbole !
6376 alex , i 'll take `` numbers we pulled out of our asses '' for $ 100 .
6377 `` there shall be no justice from this justice department muhahahahahaha '' - jeff sessions
6378 do n't worry guys , it 'll trickle down to us soon and then we 'll all make america great again !
6379 i feel more and more confident about our big move from indiana every day .
6380 unless she 's a native american she needs to commit suicide , since she 's an immigrant as well .
6381 guess who else lied about speaking to russians .. lol `` oh .. those russians ''
6382 that will show those internet trolls .
6383 she 's a bad hombre obviously
6384 how did china pay for its wall ?
6385 but i thought mexico was paying for it ?
6386 it 's all shits and giggles until someone giggles and shits .
6387 except himself , of course .
6388 concern troll is concern troll .
6389 nancy pelosi is still a fucking idiot .
6390 the aclu is fake news .
6391 trump already doing more in his first few months than obama did in 8 years !
6392 that sounds highly insufficient after lying under oath .
6393 this should be the one cabinet post where trump actually knows a qualified person and yet ... here we are
6394 no way for this to come back and bite them in the butt
6395 and you guys would be defending him .
6396 oh well now that sanders said it instead of everyone else sessions will have to resign
6397 yea , but trump 's a fucking idiot with a nice suit and a merkin cap .
6398 just like flynn ; and that turned out just fine for them .
6399 if only someone could have warned us before the election !
6400 some people elected trump because he is an aggressive businessman and will save the government money by running it like a business , they forgot though that he is also an incompetent fuckwad .
6401 he sounds very principled .
6402 yeah , it 's democrats who have to tread lightly here
6403 the hits just keep on coming .
6404 simply lovely , he is .
6405 all milo supporters this is what an attack on free speech looks like .
6406 but her emails !
6407 let 's try not getting to the point of hyperpartisanship where we start celebrating people losing their jobs
6408 * * department of homeland security * * fake news .
6409 what a complete surprise .
6410 all of them seem to think they are smarter than the media , how stupid are they ?
6411 this subreddit is beginning to be exactly like tmz .
6412 lol this is the moment he became president , guys .
6413 that 's rich coming from any news organization right now .
6414 you understand he quite literally commands the largest fighting force in the world , right ?
6415 obviously , this is how pence knew that hillary using her private e-mail was a bad idea .
6416 but he read off a teleprompter once , he 's presidential !
6417 i 'm starting to think trump may be a liar .
6418 trump supporter confuses 'slush ' with 'sushi ' , embarrassing himself on the internet .
6419 check the guidelines before submitting articles .
6420 `` uggos go over there , hot moms can come over here , and girls i 'll be dating in 10 years over there ! ''
6421 you guys need to arm up and have a good old fashioned revolution .
6422 do n't bring bannon 's love of butt plugs into this
6423 scandalous !
6424 miners can now go out and buy new cars .
6425 got ta make it easier for the russian subs to reach our coast just in case trump needs to make a quick getaway .
6426 changing the subject ?
6427 but where 's the proof !
6428 are these the same americans that said hillary would win ?
6429 they probably had significant evidence that would put hillary clinton in jail .
6430 people who have researched these things , how much does this resemble someone on a really gnarly coke binge ?
6431 # the patriot act
6432 perhaps with the mods deleting my responses , it will make you more right .
6433 obama facing 20 years of knee-slapping laughter after reading that headline .
6434 russian steel make america stronk .
6435 junk mail
6436 lol
6437 these bills solve so many problems important to the american people !
6438 early mornings like this .... trump 's meds have n't kicked in yet .
6439 trump is so in tune with the average working american !
6440 so the man who lied under oath about wiretapping all americans comes out to claim he did n't wiretap one specific person or building and we 're supposed to believe that ?
6441 old news .
6442 who needs classified briefings or other intelligence reports when you have breitbart to give you the real facts .
6443 yeah , it was such a total success before the r 's got elected
6444 wow , i 'm glad they are investigating something with facts supporting it with all of our tax dollars .
6445 the important part is the train thinks it is still on the track
6446 # spicy
6447 too bad this administration or its supporters do n't give a shit about polls or public opinion .
6448 yeah , ranting against china and kicking traditional us allies by cancelling tpp is bound to create stronger ties .
6449 yeah , because that was the only issue with the ban .
6450 this is just a coincidence .
6451 he 's busy adding pyrotechnics to the motorized podium .
6452 it 's the same as it ever was .
6453 this should be fun for everyone who is n't a billionaire .
6454 sure sucks when a country sets up tough border patrol does n't it ?
6455 but they totally do n't have a favorite .
6456 so , how 's the russia treason investigation coming along , sean ?
6457 this is the best they could come up with in 4 days .
6458 is the offer not extortion ?
6459 trump hires the best people
6460 at least that would fix the wealth gap .
6461 better get used to that feeling .
6462 why are republicans painted so harshly as these evil people hell bent on the destruction of america for their amusement ?
6463 such a maverick !
6464 shocking !
6465 republicare at its best
6466 we provide these tax cuts to our benevolent overlords so that perhaps they shine kindly down on us , showering us with entry level positions and reduced premiums .
6467 of course it does .
6468 i 'm shocked !
6469 if 22 million people are going to become uninsured how can you be so sure you wo n't be among them ?
6470 the vetting was considerably less extreme .
6471 when do libel and slander come into the picture ?
6472 wtf i love tsa now .
6473 trumpcare is going to the the greatest !
6474 this is hard for people to hear , but totally true , and it cuts the heart of what 's wrong with liberalism
6475 just call it exactly what it is : republicare
6476 because censoring the u.s president is a great idea when i disagree with him !
6477 t_d is really out in force trying to sweep this under the rug .
6478 he sweats bullets walking from his office to the bathroom , right now he is sweating cannon balls
6479 oh , look , the people who brought us `` if you like your plan , you can keep it '' are now giving us a new insightful and totally trustworthy analysis .
6480 i 'm shocked
6481 if you stop buying iphones you 'll be fine do n't worry about it .
6482 that 's coming after sharia law .
6483 umm as much as i like this story i think it violates the rules ... very very old
6484 signalling the invasion will come by sea .
6485 so much for sunbelt republican representatives .
6486 why come to america when you can go somewhere else
6487 they have to use the whitest looking arab to push white genocide .
6488 but he drained the swamp !
6489 looks like they did n't put much thought or work into the bill .
6490 lies .
6491 ha , republican governors concerned about people getting healthcare ...... this has to be fake news
6492 are you so sure about the 'free ' part ?
6493 tyranny and dictators throughout history have served up `` * those dirty despicable others * '' so that they could blame everything wrong in society on them and the rest of the population could feel superior .
6494 i bet this is negatively correlated with quality of education
6495 yes , trump is notorious for taking no heed of any criticism of him
6496 trumped up trickledown treasonomics
6497 better defund `` fake news '' pbs and npr
6498 why is there and `` if '' in the title of this post ?
6499 besides , he does n't recall what they talked about , so it 's not like it matters anyways
6500 sessions is the ambassador
6501 nothing to see , move along
6502 no reason to believe it we just do .
6503 how else you going to maga ?
6504 but the people who really matter ( defense contractors ) are happy to take it .
6505 i 'm sure that guy 's dad has no business relationships with trump inc whatsoever : d
6506 there was recently that time when obama was going to take over the state with us special forces , or the time when they were going to kidnap bush ave turn him into a muslim , or the 50 times when they were coming to take our guns away ... and that 's just in the past 8 years
6507 it 's ok because the money he makes off of this will trickle down to us normies .
6508 so concerned he might make a statement this week sometime .
6509 and you know because the pope is infallible , this is true .
6510 yes , a politician can make that call .
6511 this what happens when you force the min wage above what a business can handle
6512 not nearly as badly as is going to happen ( and is happening ) with trump , he 's shoveling money towards the wealthy with a snow shovel , nearly .
6513 it 's called the art of the deal .
6514 remind me again how clinton was the one who 's supposed to be in the saudi 's pocket ?
6515 well , i mean ...... wealthy people need iphones too !
6516 but how will we be able to support more tax cuts and give aways for those poor idiot billionaires ?
6517 in trump 's america only winner eagles with luxurious hair are allowed to survive .
6518 with his extensive background in law , we should hold his views on science as gospel .
6519 arresting more people for smoking weed should solve that , though
6520 this will ensure the victory of meth and opioids .
6521 your god will not save you now .
6522 shocking !
6523 yikes here guys , take this
6524 was clinton going to end sanctions before or after she declared war against russia and started ww3 ?
6525 i wonder how many iphones that can buy .
6526 good thing we have a congress that listens to the people .
6527 it 's sickening how much the republicans ignore democrats even in matters of national security .
6528 `` labour surcharge '' is a fancy way of saying `` we upped our prices '' , blame the gummint .
6529 well thank goodness we have an iq'less dickweed to clear that up .
6530 clearly , this is the top news story that we all need to focus on right now .
6531 flynn is venal piece of shit .
6532 yea , who need a constitution anyways .
6533 because czar drumpf is n't embarrassing anyone .
6534 because climate change implicates their own actions ( or their absolute support for the free market ) in harming people , while with 'muh refugees ' or 'muh mexicans '' or muh'bama it 's someone else 's fault .
6535 of course they did
6536 i 'm sure the people that visited the site and believed the posts will reflect deeply upon their ability to be deceived and go forth into the world with a new found resolve to question and verify the stories they read and hear .
6537 dude was too good at his job
6538 so basically elysium is our future , got it .
6539 did they not read the tweet ?
6540 well then , just hurry up , get rich and join the party .
6541 can only hope that this is the case .
6542 liar .
6543 one would almost say unpresidented .
6544 his plan was to donate it to the trump foundation , but since that seems to be having some operational issues , he decided to cut out the middle man and put his salary directly into his pocket .
6545 show me the person that is surprised by this fact and i will show you a person who has no clue what is going on
6546 you have to listen to what he means ; do n't take him so literally !
6547 trump supporters got conned by the don in a million ways .
6548 why ca n't they let 'commiefornians ' just suffer from their clean air ?
6549 she 's really got that `` modern conservative jackie '' look down
6550 welcome to todays outrage !
6551 maybe this world just needs to end : (
6552 hey , but the group he spoke w/ in germany was ok w/ the statement .
6553 he 's got the best people
6554 so happy my tax dollars continue to go to trump 's resort .
6555 lna & amp ; pbi airports will be so thrilled to hear that
6556 the oklahoma city bombing comes to mind .
6557 when you put a group of people who do n't actually want or care about universal healthcare for all , this is what you get .
6558 very convincing argument .
6559 that 's okay , i can hire him to clean my toilets , since i 'm a straight man naturally born male , hence he 'll be comfortable , i suppose .
6560 i totally trust putin 's spokesman .
6561 i swear , i 'm taking all this pent-up rage and going straight to the booth in 2018 with me and my friends and voting for every god damn democrat i can .
6562 12 days and no one posted it .
6563 hashtagstealfromliberals
6564 wow , what a * reasonable * response from a * mature adult * .
6565 this is one of those rhetorical questions .
6566 hannity , not bannon .
6567 but at least it does n't cover abortion
6568 jesus , is there a republican who is n't an ignorant racist piece of shit ?
6569 yep , some fool like this guy does n't deserve any exposure .
6570 i love watching a snake eat its own tail .
6571 i 'll be amazed if spicey shows up on time .
6572 $ 26,000 yearly wages $ 3433.75 in federal taxes $ 22566.25 after taxes ( assuming you live in a state with no income tax ) $ 8566.25 after health care $ 164.73 per week to survive sticking it to the establishment : priceless
6573 tornado warnings are librrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrulllllllllllllllllllll conspiracies !
6574 easy : they 're going to have the gender identity police do the enforcement .
6575 no , because people would rather pay for insurance than pay taxes .
6576 improving 'access ' to heaven .
6577 even the lizard i follow on instagram handled his beef with snoop dogg better than our president
6578 let 's make 88 year old grandma work , who had a hip replacement , and a stroke - the brilliance of the trump administration .
6579 ... shocker .
6580 'no one told me that sort of behaviour was frowned upon '
6581 but hey , at least he is making it easier for collection agencies to harass ppl
6582 oh yes , because he has soooooo much respect for the truth !
6583 was it you , manchin ?
6584 forward thinking there from an administration with such vision
6585 those communities did n't need those tourist dollars anyway .
6586 was bernie popular enough to beat hillary ?
6587 at least it was n't an email server .
6588 i look forward to the crayon drawn picture of obama suspended from the ceiling planting bugs in trump tower .
6589 praise kek
6590 guys , we need more bombs to drop on brown people , we ca n't afford art .
6591 it 'll be so damning , they 'll * have * to put hillary in jail !
6592 when does this administration just start smoking from a cigarette holder , dye their hair black and white , and hatch a plot to steal 99 puppies for their fur ?
6593 `` it 's only welfare leeches and refugees . ''
6594 if home bound seniors want to eat they have to earn it just like the rest of us !
6595 every time he says something incredibly stupid like this i want to punch someone who voted for him .
6596 long answer : yes short answer : we needed a businessman in the white house .
6597 someone has to think of the fat cats
6598 what is this guy trying to say though ?
6599 nothing in the nyt 's article supports the claim that obama ordered a wiretap on trump 's phone .
6600 because facts matter to these people .
6601 of course : - )
6602 rip in pepperonis roger stone
6603 but at least we get to pay for a wall !
6604 i 'm so shocked that he 's breaking his promises to coal miners
6605 `` think of the * taxpayers * ! ''
6606 well , snyder is done due to term limits , so .... not sure what his vengeance will do
6607 of course .
6608 obama spending more time on vacation .
6609 super fucking awesome idea , guys .
6610 totally did n't see this coming .
6611 america first
6612 because that 's how you maga .
6613 let them eat steak .
6614 fucking loser !
6615 i thought it was hillary who was weak and sick and did n't have the stamina .
6616 some `` never hillary '' liberals told me it makes no difference who the supreme court nominees are .
6617 i thought the whole point of electing trump was that we did n't like black males ?
6618 trying to be as far a humanly possible from trump while remaining in the country .
6619 but there 's no substantial evidence that meals and wheels did any good
6620 not only are his trips paid for by us taxpayers but those payments are going into trump 's own pockets as he owns the places getting paid .
6621 how can anyone on the plant justify dumping a bunch of shit in fresh water ?
6622 but but but fox and brietbart are great .
6623 i was willing to give president trump a chance , but this is where i draw the line !
6624 i wonder who he voted for
6625 because the united states press has been unreasonably kind to trump thus far .
6626 ooooh look how smart and deep you are .
6627 if in 4 years the left does n't have anyone better than this moron , we 're well and truly fucked .
6628 congrats , everyone , we 've become australia !
6629 the secret service has to take any opportunity to look like they 're doing their job since they let the other guy run around for 15 minutes .
6630 but after they pay half of their income on healthcare , they 'll still have loads of money for food , come on old people ....
6631 how can a member of the left afford to pay for the sign when everyone against trump are jobless snowflakes who are on welfare .
6632 i 'm just shocked to hear that !
6633 but they 'll claim it came from their invented enemy of the `` violent left . ''
6634 nasty woman .
6635 this might also be related to why he got so upset when the conservative jewish reporter asked him to denounce the wave of anti-semitism a few weeks ago .
6636 poor and homeless are losers , trumps a winner
6637 when does comey testify on russia ?
6638 yup universal care is like universal basic income : it looks good on paper but no country has ever implemented it and no country wants to be the guinea pig in an experiment and go first .
6639 ca n't tell if
6640 rather kill and imprison foreigners that help us kids .
6641 cinco de mayo in the us is just a drinking holiday for white people anyways .
6642 republicare/trumpcare .
6643 in this case i agree with sicon : service guarantees citizenship
6644 schiff : circumstantial evidence of collusion , direct evidence of deception .
6645 we 're supposed to be sympathetic to a convicted drug dealer ?
6646 i really liked the last line : `` bannon is like if the tire mud flap with the giant-breasted silhouette got a library card . ''
6647 he said , before the fbi briefing .. fake newzzzz .. sad ..
6648 and how about the illegal aliens ?
6649 this totally does n't read like a panic move .
6650 what about those jobs he `` created '' that was report last week ?
6651 * '' you would have had a health insurance , if you had n't bought an iphone '' *
6652 lock her up !
6653 that makes a fucking lot of sense .
6654 yeah when can get back to looking for the birth certificate , amirite tennessean ?
6655 but ... but ... that would be meddling into an election !
6656 i 'll bet her freinds from the homeland will be waiting for juciy intel she can share with them .
6657 no it is n't .
6658 his own lawyer lies under oath , so he 's just going to be lying the entire time .
6659 roses are red violets are blue if manafort , flynn , and sessions are on the kgb payroll trump is too
6660 pure coincidence i 'm sure .
6661 negotiating trumps exile into russia , fleeing charges in the u.s .
6662 he 's running the country like a business
6663 doing it when russia was actually communist ?
6664 there 's nothing i want more !
6665 they 're only looking there because those are the only two real news sources out there , so they probably have that information on file
6666 as transparent as a brick wall .
6667 all it takes is a week of reading the local police blotter to know that .
6668 sounds like the solemn exercise of representative democracy to me !
6669 with someone as competent as comey in charge of the fbi i 'm sure they 'll get to the bottom of this quickly .
6670 holy fuck , everything is falling down .
6671 being clear and all it should be easy for him to do , right ?
6672 oh god , they found oil on mars !
6673 geez , good thing americans do n't do that .
6674 i hope they investigate who is leaking this information .
6675 how convenient for russia and trump .
6676 really sounds like he 's got his heart and soul into the job
6677 populist fear-mongering swill .
6678 what does that have to do with any of this ?
6679 but trump 's campaign had nothing to do with russia !
6680 the people who voted for trump will soon realize they are a small minority .
6681 well at least i finally wo n't have to put up with idiots telling me trump has been good for the stock market .
6682 i bet it will start looking like the berlin wall pretty quickly .
6683 the problem i have is that the president is like a lot of my republican friends and family that think that lincoln was n't a progressive and was a conservative like the modern day republicans .
6684 what 's wrong with the other 20 % ?
6685 tillerson , your wife wanted some free time just like melania .
6686 it could also be called obstruction of justice if he delivers that info to parties at the white house who are subjects of the investigation and tips them off
6687 he looks like a douche and acts like a douche , this is n't shocking .
6688 spontaneous defenestration is quite common among males of his age .
6689 but her uranium mails !
6690 i 'm sure he did n't take a litmus test for trump .
6691 jesus take the wheel
6692 wow whoever could have seen this coming ?
6693 well you do n't say .
6694 of course , if you ca n't avoid a scam , you deserve to lose your money .
6695 republicans want the poor and middle class as scared and desperate as possible .
6696 if those lazy mothers really cared for their baby , they 'd be able to afford a 24/7 nanny .
6697 i am certain they are recoverable , so long as they do not type sudo rm * -rf that is the one thing they do not want to do if they want to recover them
6698 yes , when people call repubs the `` party of lincoln '' , they 're referring to the car brand .
6699 who among us has n't obstructed a little justice ?
6700 i wonder if russia was the `` brain condition '' that glenn beck got rid of .
6701 looking forward to their scathing expose on robert mercer !
6702 `` i 'm sorry , officer ... i did n't know i could n't do that ! ''
6703 at least he 's consistent .
6704 in before isp 's giving up your computer privacy to police , the government , etc .
6705 what the fuck would this carl bernstein hack , whoever the hell he is , know about any of this .
6706 \/d
6707 is any week ?
6708 truly a shocking development !
6709 it means you have very shady friends , and are increasingly being seen as guilty by association .
6710 yeah if he hired the whole plane row repeatedly for year by name , by total coincidence
6711 it 's constitutional so no .
6712 trump 's base that 's how .
6713 if you remember , democrats tried to rush the bill through over the course of one year , by not holding frequent debates for that time including by not relying on the unreliable cbo for information every step of the way .
6714 my way or the highway , waaa waaaaaaa
6715 ya
6716 maga = morons are governing america
6717 you know that argument makes zero sense , right ?
6718 i sometimes get the conservative republicans confused with the saudi arabia government
6719 that just means we should n't worry about it anymore .
6720 people act like this is crazy , but really you just need to convince two men they 're better off falling in line : mcconnell and ryan .
6721 such a great negotiator .
6722 tump 2020 .
6723 like he cares !
6724 the caveat is this data mostly came from dem offices because republican members are would rather withhold their own numbers from the public and their constituents than be transparent about the opposition to the bill in their own districts .
6725 i guess all they focused on was the tax cut .
6726 they 're probably getting ready to make an arrest in the `` pizzagate '' conspiracy .
6727 wow , so surprised that did n't work .
6728 yup .. the aca is failing just like cnn , the new york times , vanity fair and snoop dog .. so sad
6729 right because lifting people out of generational poverty is a bad idea
6730 well , cut them some slack , they 're still learning how to work the controls on this republic .
6731 trump can not fail only be failed .
6732 get fucked , alex .
6733 dementia is such a sad condition .
6734 i thought that clinton had him killed .
6735 not that it has anything to do with donald not being on it , but i can not take any list seriously that actually has john mccain in the top 10 for world 's greatest leaders .
6736 can i get a gatorade , i 'm parched from all this winning .
6737 well , that worked out well did n't it ?
6738 he might be in leagle trouble
6739 got ta communicate with the ruskies some way
6740 but hes making deeaaaals man , it 's okay cause he makes deal on the golf course like a businessman
6741 well , djt is president so he must be doing something better than you .
6742 of course .... he does his best thinking when he 's playing golf ... why do you think he 's always down there each weekend ?
6743 oh look , the dems are back to banging the ear drums again .
6744 well , he 's president and you 're not .
6745 if it does n't maga , the supreme overlord did n't have a part in it !
6746 good luck with that !
6747 with over a billion terrorists ( muslims ) out there , what 's the islamophobe in chief to do .
6748 that means treason case must be worse than the holocaust then .
6749 traitor gowdy
6750 maybe he 'll give his tapes to bebe rebozo
6751 after a long week of regularly getting hit in the balls , its probably what i would do too .
6752 trumpism = * 'religion of peace ' *
6753 what happened to the strong alpha male trump supporters ?
6754 what a useful use of useless money
6755 after ?
6756 wahhhhhhhhhhh
6757 someone 's been watching the west wing
6758 it 's worth mentioning that betsy devos 's definition of `` god 's kingdom '' is a place where people obey conservative and religious values without a second thought .
6759 i 'm sure it 's just all a big coincidence
6760 hmm ... continue , we are listening to this act subversion unfold .
6761 wait ... since when did dick cheney want us to go to war ?
6762 make america last again !
6763 nothing suprising considering new healthcare did not go through
6764 the city council should vote to change the city 's name to 'putingrad ' every time trump visits and vote to change it back every time he leaves .
6765 so i guess we can expect actions against corporations hiring illegals next , right ?
6766 followup question , is abromovich flying to aspen every weekend or only times when trump/kushner are there ?
6767 well , i guess it 's pack up then
6768 ... and schumer needs a head transplant .
6769 he is one of you , right ?
6770 i 'm ashamed this man came from my neighborhood .
6771 why would you want an educated and healthy society when these mexicans are stealing out tax dollars ?
6772 we got ta get a lot more taco trucks out on the streets if those mexicans are ever gon na pay their share
6773 take it easy schiff , i ca n't keep getting boners at dinner like this .
6774 i ca n't believe liberals would force a woman to live with her abuser .
6775 a win for the working man !
6776 so you 're saying you need to have concrete evidence before you have an open and transparent investigation ?
6777 the growing culture of immigrant hate and inhumane treatment ( ics arrests in courthouses ) , or the appearance of such , has done far more to stop immigration than any wall ever could .
6778 and of course the wh is saying it 's totally fake .
6779 this russian scandal is worse than watergate already .
6780 when did he start doing that ?
6781 and he probably would 've bounced it
6782 looks like nunes finally found comey 's phone number .
6783 getting ready for that 2018 election , making sure democrats info is nice and easy to acquire online since that seems to be the only thing winning them anything these days .
6784 because jason chaffetz represents the highest level of ethical republicans .
6785 just remember come 2018/2020 to give people something to vote for and not just against - cuz that sh-t could blow up in your face again .
6786 just look for a tweet that does n't have a large vocabul .. vocab ... vocabu ... somebody who does n't use big words
6787 what a shock !
6788 as much as the guy is a piece of garbage , rotten tomatoes make for longer entertainment , as death by being pelted with rotten tomatoes takes longer than death by being pelted with bricks .
6789 looks like you guys got ta just murder your politicians like they do in russia and that fixes things
6790 but i thought there was no difference between democrats and republicans ?
6791 most evangelicals care more about a bundle of cells instead of all other life on earth .
6792 can a logical trump supporter explain to me how you support this man ?
6793 you mean freedom dressing .....
6794 lol ok yeah nothing shady about that
6795 proposed solution : introduce branded products trumpycontin , trumpanyl , and trumpodile .
6796 ~~honors~~ dishonors
6797 next one of these : trumps rating divebombs to 34.5 %
6798 honest question : how old are you ?
6799 how can he do that when he 's busy paying protestors ?
6800 but hillary operates a huge child trafficking ring !
6801 i 'm so glad such a woman of distinction , who never had anything handed to her and has the political experience to really make a difference is now an official employee .
6802 he also just reads playboy for the articles .
6803 he 's just trying to expand his electorate .
6804 quietly ?
6805 i wonder how many conservatives care about this at all .
6806 raping the taxpayers , feels good man
6807 uh yeah sure comrade cause you 're so trustworthy and righteous and all ...
6808 because the kansas economy is doing so well .
6809 are n't they technically the ussr ?
6810 good thing he 's a scientist
6811 new jersey please follow suit .
6812 it 's all a hoax !
6813 that not how that works , it not how any of this works .
6814 how can we trust an administration who lies then lies about those lies who acts like they are hunted though hunts
6815 it 's like the final chapter of a scorsese film .
6816 starbucks encourages * any * coffee drinking .
6817 yeah , i imagine darpanet was awash in buzz over the watergate mess .
6818 but giving tax cuts to the rich helps the economy
6819 but , but , hillary is an f-
6820 you 're wrong , hillary clinton will instill fear into the hearts of donald trump and republicans alike
6821 haha , now you know that they are worried .
6822 good thing people that are already rich have everyone else 's concerns in mind .
6823 kind of hard to make a big deal about this when we have been selling weapons to saudi arabia who is one of the worst violators of human rights .
6824 he committed treason by ensuring that the next guy could n't successfully commit treason .
6825 he doesnt really care , he can just move back to kenya .
6826 good to know they spent their time doing useful things for our country .
6827 but then he would n't be exempted from lawsuits
6828 username checks out
6829 polls have been extremely reliable as of late so i 'm taking this one to the bank .
6830 i 'm not sure about you guys , but the swamp is looking pretty drained to me .
6831 no he looks like a winner
6832 our lord emperor is scared of no man , just wait and see what he tweets next .
6833 careful now , arby 's has more employees than the coal industry , are you sure you want to make that comparison ?
